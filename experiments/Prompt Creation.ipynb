    "\n",
    "- `text` - The text of the prompt that will be sent to OpenAI (ChatGPT, or GPT-4, or any other model that can be used to create a dataset). The prompt needs to have at least two placeholders. First, `context` - the content of a document that will be used to generate question/answer pairs, or a conversation, or anything else. And second, `language` in what language do we want the output to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `description` - A short description of what is this prompt for and how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `parser` - The parser to be used to parse the output from a Teacher (e.g. OpenAI, Google).\n",
