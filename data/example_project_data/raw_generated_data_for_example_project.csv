1;What is considered a high blood pressure reading?;Blood pressure readings recorded with 2 numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is considered high when it is above 140, while the diastolic pressure (lower number) is high when it is above 90. However, readings between 120/80mmHg and 140/90mmHg could mean you're at risk of developing high blood pressure if you do not take steps to keep your blood pressure under control. The ideal blood pressure is usually between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg.
2;What are the risks of having high blood pressure?;If your blood pressure is too high, it puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and eyes. Persistent high blood pressure can increase your risk of a number of serious and potentially life-threatening health conditions, such as heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysms, kidney disease, and vascular dementia. However, reducing high blood pressure even a small amount can help lower your risk of these health conditions.
3;What lifestyle changes can help prevent and lower high blood pressure?;These lifestyle changes can help prevent and lower high blood pressure: reduce the amount of salt you eat and have a generally healthy diet, cut back on alcohol, lose weight if you're overweight, exercise regularly, cut down on caffeine, and stop smoking. However, the effectiveness of these changes may vary for each person and it's important to talk to your doctor about your options.
4;What kind of medicines can help control high blood pressure?;If you're diagnosed with high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend taking one or more medicines to keep it under control. These medicines include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, diuretics, beta blockers, alpha blockers, and other diuretics. The medicine recommended for you will depend on things like how high your blood pressure is, your age, and your ethnicity. However, it's important to talk to your doctor before taking any medicine and to follow their instructions carefully.
5;What are some things that can increase the risk of getting high blood pressure?;There are several things that can increase the risk of getting high blood pressure, including being overweight, eating too much salt and not enough fruits and vegetables, not doing enough exercise, drinking too much alcohol or coffee, smoking, not getting enough sleep or having disturbed sleep, being over 65 years old, having a relative with high blood pressure, being of black African or black Caribbean descent, and living in a deprived area. However, making healthy lifestyle changes can sometimes help reduce your chances of getting high blood pressure and help lower your blood pressure if it's already high.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,0,f53cf99826,a886c127f3f267e647b41b8f12caf0fac51bec9ff2d90893ee01522e4e700b71,"Overview
High blood pressure (hypertension)
High blood pressure, or hypertension, rarely has noticeable symptoms. But if untreated, it increases your risk of serious problems such as heart attacks and strokes.
Around a third of adults in the UK have high blood pressure, although many will not realise it.
The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have your blood pressure checked.
What is high blood pressure?
Blood pressure is recorded with 2 numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body.
The diastolic pressure (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels.
They're both measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg).
As a general guide:
high blood pressure is considered to be from 140/90mmHg (or an average of 135/85mmHg at home) – or 150/90mmHg (or an average of 145/85mmHg at home) if you're over the age of 80
ideal blood pressure is usually considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg, while the target for over-80s is below 150/90mmHg (or 145/85mmHg at home)
Blood pressure readings between 120/80mmHg and 140/90mmHg could mean you're at risk of developing high blood pressure if you do not take steps to keep your blood pressure under control.
Everyone's blood pressure will be slightly different. What's considered low or high for you may be normal for someone else.
Risks of high blood pressure
If your blood pressure is too high, it puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes.
Persistent high blood pressure can increase your risk of a number of serious and potentially life-threatening health conditions, such as:
heart disease
heart attacks
strokes
heart failure
peripheral arterial disease
aortic aneurysms
kidney disease
vascular dementia
If you have high blood pressure, reducing it even a small amount can help lower your risk of these health conditions.
Check your blood pressure
The only way of knowing whether you have high blood pressure is to have a blood pressure test.
All adults over 40 are advised to have their blood pressure checked at least every 5 years.
Getting this done is easy and could save your life.
You can get your blood pressure tested at a number of places, including:
at your GP surgery
at some pharmacies
as part of your NHS Health Check
in some workplaces
You can also check your blood pressure yourself with a home blood pressure monitor.
Find out more about getting a blood pressure test
Things that can increase your risk of getting high blood pressure
It's not always clear what causes high blood pressure, but there are things that can increase your risk.
You might be more at risk if you:
are overweight
eat too much salt and do not eat enough fruit and vegetables
do not do enough exercise
drink too much alcohol or coffee (or other caffeine-based drinks)
smoke
do not get much sleep or have disturbed sleep
are over 65
have a relative with high blood pressure
are of black African or black Caribbean descent
live in a deprived area
Making healthy lifestyle changes can sometimes help reduce your chances of getting high blood pressure and help lower your blood pressure if it's already high.

1,"ID;Question;Answer
1;What is bronchiolitis and who is most susceptible to it?;Bronchiolitis is a chest infection that usually affects infants and children under two years of age. It is caused by a viral infection, commonly the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Children who were born prematurely, have a heart or lung condition, or weakened immune system, are at higher risk of getting severely ill with bronchiolitis.
2;What are the signs of bronchiolitis in children and when should I seek medical attention?;The early signs of bronchiolitis are similar to that of a cold including sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, a cough, and a slightly high temperature of 38C. Other symptoms include breathing more quickly, difficulty feeding or eating, noisy breathing (wheezing), and irritability. The cough usually gets better within 3 weeks. Seek immediate medical attention by calling 999 or going to the A&E if your child is having difficulty breathing, there are pauses when your child breathes, your child's skin, tongue or lips are blue, or your child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake. For urgent help, ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if your child has had a cold and it is getting worse, your child is not eating or drinking as normal, your child has been dry for 12 hours or more or shows other signs of dehydration, or your baby has a fever of 38C or higher if under 3 months old or a fever of 39C or higher if older than 3 months.
3;What treatments are available for bronchiolitis?;There is no specific cure for bronchiolitis, but it can be treated at home. You can give your child children's paracetamol to babies and children over two months or ibuprofen to babies and children over three months. If your child's nose is blocked, try using saline drops and keep them upright as much as possible when they are awake. Encourage your child to drink lots of fluids. Do not give aspirin to children under the age of 16. Hospital treatment may be necessary for children who are severely affected.
4;How can bronchiolitis be prevented?;To prevent the incidence of bronchiolitis in children, there are several measures parents can take. Regular hand washing is highly recommended, and cleaning surfaces frequently, keeping newborn babies away from other kids who have a cold or flu are other preventative measures. Use disposable tissues and throw them away right after use and avoid smoking around your child because second-hand smoke puts children at higher risk of getting bronchiolitis.
5;What is the difference between bronchiolitis and bronchitis?;Bronchiolitis usually affects babies and children under 2 and does not usually progress beyond their tenth day of illness. It causes symptoms such as runny or blocked nose, cough, and difficulty breathing. Bronchitis, on the other hand, affects people of all ages and causes cough with lots of mucus. Symptoms of bronchitis include cough, fatigue, slight fever, and chest discomfort. Unlike bronchiolitis, bronchitis can last from several days to weeks.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,0,f53cf99826,ca0cc4cd9acd981724d8478f85610d37679383bbb330cb17b4141541cb2ba3d7,"Bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is a common chest infection that affects babies and children under 2. It's usually mild and can be treated at home, but it can be serious.
Bronchiolitis is different from bronchitis, which causes a cough with lots of mucus and can affect people of all ages.
Check if it's bronchiolitis
The early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to a cold, such as sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, a cough and a slightly high temperature of 38C.
A child with bronchiolitis may then get other symptoms, such as:
breathing more quickly
finding it difficult to feed or eat
noisy breathing (wheezing)
becoming irritable
Symptoms are usually worst between days 3 and 5, and the cough usually gets better in 3 weeks.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if:
your child is having difficulty breathing – you may notice grunting noises or their tummy sucking under their ribs
there are pauses when your child breathes
your child's skin, tongue or lips are blue
your child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake
As a parent, you may know if your child seems seriously unwell and should trust your own judgement.
Find your nearest A&E
Urgent advice:
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if:
your child has had a cold and it's getting worse
your child is feeding or eating much less than normal
your child has had a dry nappy for 12 hours or more, or shows other signs of dehydration
your baby is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38C, or is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39C or higher
your baby feels hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, or feels sweaty
your child is very tired or irritable
Treatments for bronchiolitis
There's no specific treatment for bronchiolitis. It usually gets better on its own and you can look after your child at home.
But it can be serious in some children, who may need to be treated in hospital.
Do
give children's paracetamol to babies and children over 2 months old or ibuprofen to babies and children over 3 months old – but do not give aspirin to a child under 16
try using salt water (saline) drops if your child's nose is blocked
keep your child upright as much as possible when they're awake – this will help them breathe more easily
encourage your child to drink lots of fluids – try smaller feeds more often in babies, and give older children extra water or diluted fruit juice
Don’t
do not smoke around your child
do not try to lower your child's temperature by sponging them with cool water or taking off all their clothes
Preventing bronchiolitis
There are some things you can do to lower the chances of your child getting bronchiolitis or spreading the viruses that cause it, such as:
wash your hands and your child's hands often
wash or wipe down toys and clean surfaces regularly
use disposable tissues and throw them away as soon as you've used them
keep newborn babies away from anyone with a cold or the flu – especially if they're under 2 months old or were premature
It's also important not to smoke around your child. Children who breathe in cigarette smoke have a higher risk of getting bronchiolitis.
Children at risk of severe bronchiolitis
Some children may have a higher risk of getting seriously ill with bronchiolitis.
This includes children who:
were born very prematurely
have a heart or lung condition
have a weakened immune system
These children may be able to have treatment in the winter (between October and March) to stop them getting severe bronchiolitis.
Causes of bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is caused by a viral infection, usually the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
RSV is very common and spreads easily in coughs and sneezes. Almost all children have had it by the time they're 2.
In older children and adults, RSV may cause a cough or cold, but in young children it can cause bronchiolitis."

3,"Patient: Hi, I have been experiencing joint pain lately. Can steroids help me with the pain?

AI-Assistant: Hi! Steroids can be used to treat joint pain caused by conditions like arthritis or frozen shoulder. However, it's important to only take them as prescribed by your doctor, as steroids can have side effects.

Patient: What are the different types of steroids available?

AI-Assistant: Steroids come in many different forms. The main types are tablets, syrups, liquids, inhalers, nasal sprays, injections, creams, lotions, and gels. Most steroids are only available on prescription, but a few (such as some creams or nasal sprays) can be bought from pharmacies and shops.

Patient: Are there any side effects of taking steroids?

AI-Assistant: Steroids do not tend to cause significant side effects if they're taken for a short time or at a low dose. But sometimes they can cause unpleasant side effects, such as an increased appetite, mood changes, and difficulty sleeping. This is most common with steroid tablets. The side effects will usually pass once you finish the treatment, but do not stop taking your medicine without speaking to your doctor.

Patient: Can steroids be used to treat eczema?

AI-Assistant: Yes, steroids can be used to treat eczema. Creams, lotions, and gels containing steroids can be applied directly onto the skin to help reduce redness and itching caused by eczema or other skin conditions.

Patient: I have recently been diagnosed with lupus. Can steroids help me with this condition?

AI-Assistant: Yes, steroids can be used to treat autoimmune conditions like lupus. Steroids reduce the activity of the immune system, which is the body's natural defense against illness and infection. This can help treat autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body. However, you should always follow the treatment plan prescribed by your doctor, as steroids can have side effects if not taken correctly.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,0,f4df95ec69,14142c96ed663d1313091800a7778df104e50577c26f23b6a15ce8c6febc8c84,"Steroids
Steroids, also called corticosteroids, are anti-inflammatory medicines used to treat a range of conditions.
They're different from anabolic steroids, which are often used illegally by some people to increase their muscle mass.
Types of steroids
Steroids come in many different forms.
The main types are:
tablets, syrups and liquids – such as prednisolone
inhalers – such as beclometasone and fluticasone
nasal sprays – such as beclometasone and fluticasone
injections (given into joints, muscles or blood vessels) – such as methylprednisolone

painful joints or muscles – such as arthritis, tennis elbow and frozen shoulder
pain caused by an irritated or trapped nerve – such as sciatica
inflammatory bowel disease – such as Crohn's disease
lupus
multiple sclerosis (MS)
How steroids work
Steroids are a man-made version of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands which are 2 small glands found above the kidneys.
When taken in doses higher than the amount your body normally produces, steroids reduce redness and swelling (inflammation). This can help with inflammatory conditions such as asthma and eczema.
Steroids also reduce the activity of the immune system, which is the body's natural defence against illness and infection.
This can help treat autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body."

1;What are the symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?;The symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease include loss of intellect and memory, changes in personality, loss of balance and co-ordination, slurred speech, vision problems and blindness, abnormal jerking movements, and progressive loss of brain function and mobility. Most people with CJD will die within a year of the symptoms starting, usually from infection. This is because the immobility caused by CJD can make people with the condition vulnerable to infection.
2;What is the cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease appears to be caused by an abnormal infectious protein called a prion. These prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells. While the abnormal prions are technically infectious, they're very different from viruses and bacteria. For example, prions aren't destroyed by the extremes of heat and radiation used to kill bacteria and viruses, and antibiotics or antiviral medicines have no effect on them.
3;What are the types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?;There are 4 main types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Sporadic CJD, which is the most common type, occurs when the normal brain protein changes abnormally (""misfolds"") and turns into a prion. Variant CJD is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or ""mad cow"" disease), a similar prion disease to CJD. Familial CJD is a very rare genetic condition. Iatrogenic CJD is where the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment.

Read more about the causes of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Types of CJD
There are 4 main types of CJD.
Sporadic CJD
Sporadic CJD is the most common type.
The precise cause of sporadic CJD is unclear, but it's been suggested that a normal brain protein changes abnormally (""misfolds"") and turns into a prion.
Most cases of sporadic CJD occur in adults aged between 45 and 75. On average, symptoms develop between the ages of 60 and 65.
Despite being the most common type of CJD, sporadic CJD is still very rare, affecting only 1 or 2 people in every million each year in the UK.
In 2020, there were 131 recorded deaths from sporadic CJD in the UK.
Variant CJD
Variant CJD (vCJD) is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or ""mad cow"" disease), a similar prion disease to CJD.
Since the link between variant CJD and BSE was discovered in 1996, strict controls have proved very effective in preventing meat from infected cattle entering the food chain.
See preventing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease for more information.
But the average time it takes for the symptoms of variant CJD to occur after initial infection (the incubation period) is still unclear.
The incubation period could be very long (more than 10 years) in some people, so those exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced can still develop variant CJD.
The prion that causes variant CJD can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, although this has only happened 5 times in the UK.
In 2020, there were no recorded deaths from variant CJD in the UK.
Familial or inherited CJD
Familial CJD is a very rare genetic condition where one of the genes a person inherits from their parent (the prion protein gene) carries a mutation that causes prions to form in their brain during adulthood, triggering the symptoms of CJD.
It affects about 1 in every 9 million people in the UK.
The symptoms of familial CJD usually first develop in people when they're in their early 50s.
In 2020, there were 6 deaths from familial CJD and similar inherited prion diseases in the UK.
Iatrogenic CJD
Iatrogenic CJD is where the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment.
For example, a common cause of iatrogenic CJD in the past was growth hormone treatment using human pituitary growth hormones extracted from deceased individuals, some of whom were infected with CJD.
Synthetic versions of human growth hormone have been used since 1985, so this is no longer a risk.
Iatrogenic CJD can also occur if instruments used during brain surgery on a person with CJD aren't properly cleaned between each surgical procedure and are reused on another person.
But increased awareness of these risks means iatrogenic CJD is now very rare.
In 2020, there was 1 death from iatrogenic CJD in the UK caused by receiving human growth hormone before 1985.
How CJD is treated
There's currently no cure for CJD, so treatment aims to relieve symptoms and make the affected person feel as comfortable as possible.
This can include using medicine such as antidepressants to help with anxiety and depression, and painkillers to relieve pain.
Some people will need nursing care and assistance with feeding.

Atopic eczema
Atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most common form of eczema, a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, dry and cracked.
Atopic eczema is more common in children, often developing before their first birthday. But it may also develop for the first time in adults.
It's usually a long-term (chronic) condition, although it can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older.
Symptoms of atopic eczema
Atopic eczema causes the skin to become itchy, dry, cracked and sore.
Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread inflamed skin all over the body.
Inflamed skin can become red on lighter skin, and darker brown, purple or grey on darker skin. This can also be more difficult to see on darker skin.
Although atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, it most often affects the hands, insides of the elbows, backs of the knees and the face and scalp in children.
People with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups).
When to seek medical advice
See a GP if you have symptoms of atopic eczema. They'll usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions, such as:
whether the rash is itchy and where it appears
when the symptoms first began
whether it comes and goes over time
whether there's a history of atopic eczema in your family
whether you have any other conditions, such as allergies or asthma
whether something in your diet or lifestyle may be contributing to your symptoms
Typically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and 3 or more of the following:
visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin – such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional
a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above
generally dry skin in the last 12 months
a history of asthma or hay fever – children under 4 must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has 1 of these conditions
the condition started before the age of 2 (this does not apply to children under the age of 4)
Causes of atopic eczema
The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it's clear it is not down to one single thing.
Atopic eczema often occurs in people who get allergies. ""Atopic"" means sensitivity to allergens.
It can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever.
The symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather.
Sometimes food allergies can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema.
You may be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse.
Allergy tests are not usually needed, although they're sometimes helpful in identifying whether a food allergy may be triggering symptoms.
Treating atopic eczema
Treatment for atopic eczema can help to relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time.
But there's currently no cure and severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life, which may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally.
There's also an increased risk of skin infections.
Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including:
self-care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers
emollients (moisturising treatments) – used on a daily basis for dry skin
topical corticosteroids – used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups
Other types of eczema
Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin.
Other types of eczema include:
discoid eczema – a type of eczema that occurs in circular or oval patches on the skin
contact dermatitis – a type of eczema that occurs when the body comes into contact with a particular substance
varicose eczema – a type of eczema that most often affects the lower legs and is caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins
seborrhoeic eczema – a type of eczema where red, scaly patches develop on the sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears and scalp
dyshidrotic eczema (pompholyx) – a type of eczema that causes tiny blisters to erupt across the palms of the hands"

Q1;What is HIV and how does it affect the body?;HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is a virus that attacks the immune system by damaging the cells responsible for fighting infections and diseases. When HIV is left untreated, it can progress to AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the immune system has been severely damaged. HIV weakens the immune system and makes it more difficult for the body to fight common infections and diseases, which can result in severe illnesses and even death.
Q2;How is HIV transmitted from one person to another?;HIV is primarily transmitted through the exchange of body fluids, including semen, vaginal fluids, blood, and breast milk. The most common way of getting HIV is through unprotected anal or vaginal sex with an infected person. Sharing needles, syringes, or other injecting equipment with someone who is infected with HIV can also lead to transmission. Finally, HIV can be transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. It's important to note that HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat, urine, or saliva.
Q3;What are some effective ways to prevent or reduce the risk of HIV infection?;There are several effective ways to prevent or reduce the risk of HIV infection, including using a condom during sex, practicing post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) following potential exposure to the virus, taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and using treatment for HIV to reduce the viral load to undetectable levels. If you use drugs, never share needles or other injecting equipment, including syringes, spoons, and swabs. It's important to speak with your local sexual health clinic or a GP for further advice about the best way to reduce your risk.
Q4;What are some common symptoms of HIV infection?;Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after HIV infection, which lasts for a week or 2. After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years, but the virus continues to damage the immune system. This means many people with HIV do not know they're infected. Anyone who thinks they could have HIV should get tested. Some people are advised to have regular tests as they're at particularly high risk.
Q5;What are some of the ways to diagnose HIV?;The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection. You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics, and clinics run by charities. It's recommended to seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV. Clinics may offer a finger prick blood test, which can give you a result in minutes, but it may take up to a few days to get the results of a more detailed HIV test. Home testing or home sampling kits are also available to buy online or from pharmacies. If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result. If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,0,f53cf99826,bfd4562d8170757f96b41dc34965220f1bd48435f9e510972e3e7c05447810e9,"Overview
HIV and AIDS
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system and weakens your ability to fight everyday infections and disease.
AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus.
While AIDS cannot be transmitted from 1 person to another, the HIV virus can.
There's currently no cure for HIV, but there are very effective drug treatments that enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life.
With an early diagnosis and effective treatments, most people with HIV will not develop any AIDS-related illnesses and will live a near-normal lifespan.
Symptoms of HIV infection
Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after HIV infection, which lasts for a week or 2.
After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years, although the virus continues to damage your immune system.
This means many people with HIV do not know they're infected.
Anyone who thinks they could have HIV should get tested.
Some people are advised to have regular tests as they're at particularly high risk.

Causes of HIV infection
HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person. This includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood and breast milk.
It's a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long.
HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat, urine or saliva.
The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through having anal or vaginal sex without a condom.
Other ways of getting HIV include:
sharing needles, syringes or other injecting equipment
transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding
The chance of getting HIV through oral sex is very low and will be dependent on many things, such as whether you receive or give oral sex and the oral hygiene of the person giving the oral sex.
Diagnosing HIV
Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV.
You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities.
Find HIV testing services near you
The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection.
It's important to be aware that:
emergency anti-HIV medicine called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may stop you becoming infected if started within 72 hours of possible exposure to the virus – it's recommended that you start it as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours
an early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the virus, reduce the risk of becoming more unwell and reduce the chance of passing the virus on to others
Both positive and negative HIV tests may need to be repeated 1 to 3 months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the window period), but you should not wait this long to seek help:
clinics may offer a finger prick blood test, which can give you a result in minutes, but it may take up to a few days to get the results of a more detailed HIV test
home testing or home sampling kits are available to buy online or from pharmacies – depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few days
If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result.
If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options.
Treatment for HIV
Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage.
These come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day.
HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV medicine very easily, but taking a combination of different medicines makes this much less likely.
Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines. It's vital these are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.
The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load. This means the level of HIV virus in your body is low enough to not be detected by a test.
Living with HIV
If you're living with HIV, taking effective HIV treatment and being undetectable significantly reduces your risk of passing HIV on to others.
You'll also be encouraged to:
take regular exercise
eat a healthy diet
stop smoking
have yearly flu jabs to minimise the risk of getting serious illnesses
Without treatment, the immune system will become severely damaged, and life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and severe infections can occur.
If you're planning on getting pregnant, it's important to talk to a GP. Although rare, it's possible to transmit HIV to your baby.
Preventing HIV
Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV infection.
There are many effective ways to prevent or reduce the risk of HIV infection, including:
using a condom for sex
post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
treatment for HIV to reduce the viral load to undetectable
if you use drugs, never sharing needles or other injecting equipment, including syringes, spoons and swabs
Speak to your local sexual health clinic or a GP for further advice about the best way to reduce your risk.
For people with HIV, if you have been taking effective HIV treatment and your viral load has been undetectable for 6 months or more, it means you cannot pass the virus on through sex.
This is called undetectable=untransmittable (U=U).

7,"Patient: Hi, I'm a bit worried about some symptoms I've been experiencing. Can you tell me more about heart attacks?

AI-Assistant: Of course, I can help you with that. What specifically would you like to know?

Patient: What are the symptoms of a heart attack?

AI-Assistant: Symptoms of a heart attack can include chest pain, pain in other parts of the body, feeling lightheaded or dizzy, sweating, shortness of breath, feeling sick or being sick, an overwhelming feeling of anxiety, coughing or wheezing. The chest pain is often severe, but some people may only experience minor pain, similar to indigestion.

Patient: What should I do if I think I'm having a heart attack?

AI-Assistant: If you suspect a heart attack, it's important to call 999 and ask for an ambulance immediately. The faster you act, the better your chances of survival.

Patient: How is a heart attack treated?

AI-Assistant: In hospital, treatment for a heart attack depends on how serious it is. The two main treatments are using medicines to dissolve blood clots and surgery to help restore blood to the heart.

Patient: What causes a heart attack?

AI-Assistant: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart attacks. CHD is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart get clogged with deposits of cholesterol, known as plaques. Before a heart attack, one of the plaques bursts (ruptures), causing a blood clot to develop at the site of the rupture.

Patient: Can a heart attack be prevented?

AI-Assistant: There are 5 main steps you can take to reduce your risk of having a heart attack: smokers should quit smoking, lose weight if you're overweight or obese, do regular exercise, eat a healthy diet and moderate your alcohol consumption. These lifestyle changes can help reduce your risk of heart disease and heart attacks.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,0,f4df95ec69,be557d568ab1aecde5d52fca6b1bfbac11bb14d572c825a1f307c2dc39ceba1c,"Overview
Heart attack
A heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI) is a serious medical emergency in which the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked, usually by a blood clot.
A heart attack is a medical emergency. Call 999 and ask for an ambulance if you suspect a heart attack.
A lack of blood to the heart may seriously damage the heart muscle and can be life threatening.
Symptoms of a heart attack
Symptoms of a heart attack can include:
chest pain – a feeling of pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across your chest
pain in other parts of the body – it can feel as if the pain is spreading from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and tummy
feeling lightheaded or dizzy
sweating
shortness of breath
feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)
an overwhelming feeling of anxiety (similar to a panic attack)
coughing or wheezing
The chest pain is often severe, but some people may only experience minor pain, similar to indigestion.
While the most common symptom in both men and women is chest pain, women are more likely to have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, feeling or being sick and back or jaw pain.
Call 999 immediately if you think someone might be having a heart attack. The faster you act, the better their chances.
Treating heart attacks
While waiting for an ambulance, it may help to chew and then swallow a tablet of aspirin (ideally 300mg), as long as the person having a heart attack is not allergic to aspirin.
Aspirin helps to thin the blood and improves blood flow to the heart.
In hospital, treatment for a heart attack depends on how serious it is.
The 2 main treatments are:
using medicines to dissolve blood clots
surgery to help restore blood to the heart
Causes of a heart attack
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart attacks.
CHD is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart get clogged with deposits of cholesterol, known as plaques.
Before a heart attack, 1 of the plaques bursts (ruptures), causing a blood clot to develop at the site of the rupture.
The clot may block the supply of blood to the heart, triggering a heart attack.
Recovering from a heart attack
The time it takes to recover from a heart attack will depend on the amount of damage to your heart muscle.
Most people can return to work after having a heart attack. Some people are well enough to return to work after 2 weeks. Other people may take several months to recover. How quickly you can go back to work depends on your health, the state of your heart and the type of work you do.
The recovery process aims to:
reduce your risk of another heart attack through a combination of lifestyle changes (such as eating a healthy diet), and medicines (such as statins), which help to lower blood cholesterol levels
gradually restore your physical fitness so you can resume normal activities (cardiac rehabilitation)
Find out more about recovering from a heart attack
Complications of a heart attack
Complications of a heart attack can be serious and possibly life threatening.
These include:
arrhythmias – these are abnormal heartbeats. 1 type is where the heart begins beating faster and faster, then stops beating (cardiac arrest)
cardiogenic shock – where the heart's muscles are severely damaged and can no longer contract properly to supply enough blood to maintain many body functions
heart rupture – where the heart's muscles, walls or valves split apart (rupture)
These complications can happen quickly after a heart attack and are a leading cause of death.
Many people die suddenly from a complication of a heart attack before reaching hospital or within the 1st month after a heart attack.
The outlook often depends on:
age – serious complications are more likely as you get older
the severity of the heart attack – how much of the heart's muscle has been damaged during the attack
how long it took before a person received treatment – treatment for a heart attack should begin as soon as possible
Find out more about complications of a heart attack
Preventing a heart attack
There are 5 main steps you can take to reduce your risk of having a heart attack (or having another heart attack):
smokers should quit smoking
lose weight if you're overweight or obese
do regular exercise – adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week, unless advised otherwise by the doctor in charge of your care
eat a low-fat, high-fibre diet, including wholegrains and at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day
moderate your alcohol consumption

1;What are the main symptoms of laryngitis?;The main symptoms of laryngitis are a hoarse (croaky) voice, sometimes losing your voice, an irritating cough that does not go away, always needing to clear your throat, and a sore throat. Children can also have a temperature of 38C or above, be off their food or drink, or have difficulty breathing (but this is rare). Laryngitis is often linked to other illnesses, such as colds and flu, so you may also have other symptoms.
2;Can laryngitis be treated at home?;Yes, laryngitis can be treated at home. Laryngitis usually goes away on its own after 1 to 2 weeks and you do not need to see a GP. To treat laryngitis at home, try to speak as little as possible, drink plenty of fluids, keep the air moist by putting out bowls of water, gargle with warm salty water (not suitable for younger children), and avoid talking loudly or whispering, smoking, spending time in smoky or dusty places, and drinking too much caffeine or alcohol as they cause dehydration. Speak to a pharmacist about your sore throat for advice and treatments, including paracetamol or ibuprofen, cough syrup to help with your cough, solutions to gargle, or lozenges for the pain.
3;What should I do if my laryngitis symptoms do not improve after 2 weeks?;If your laryngitis symptoms do not improve after 2 weeks, you should see a GP. The GP will try to work out what has caused your laryngitis and may look inside your throat using a small mirror, wipe a cotton bud around the back of your throat for testing, arrange a blood test, or refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist (if you keep getting laryngitis). If your laryngitis is caused by an infection, the GP might prescribe antibiotics.
4;What causes laryngitis besides cold or flu infection?;Laryngitis can be caused by various factors besides cold or flu infection. Other things that cause laryngitis include allergies to things like dust and fumes, acid from your stomach coming up your throat (acid reflux), coughing over a long time, and clearing your throat all the time. However, laryngitis is often linked to other illnesses, such as colds and flu, so you may also have other symptoms.
5;What should I do if I or my child is having difficulty breathing due to laryngitis?;If you or your child is having difficulty breathing due to laryngitis, you should call 999 or go to A&E immediately.

1;What are the symptoms of multiple sclerosis?;The symptoms of multiple sclerosis vary widely from person to person and can affect any part of the body. The main symptoms include fatigue, difficulty walking, vision problems, such as blurred vision, problems controlling the bladder, numbness or tingling in different parts of the body, muscle stiffness and spasms, problems with balance and co-ordination, and problems with thinking, learning and planning. Depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms may come and go in phases or get steadily worse over time (progress).
2;What causes multiple sclerosis?;Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune condition. This is when something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks a healthy part of the body – in this case, the brain or spinal cord of the nervous system. In MS, the immune system attacks the layer that surrounds and protects the nerves called the myelin sheath. This damages and scars the sheath, and potentially the underlying nerves, meaning that messages travelling along the nerves become slowed or disrupted. Exactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is unclear, but most experts think a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved.
3;What treatments are available for multiple sclerosis?;There's currently no cure for multiple sclerosis, but a number of treatments can help control the condition and ease symptoms. The treatment you need will depend on the specific symptoms and difficulties you have. It may include treating relapses with short courses of steroid medicine to speed up recovery, specific treatments for individual MS symptoms, and treatment to reduce the number of relapses using medicines called disease-modifying therapies. Disease-modifying therapies may also help to slow or reduce the overall worsening of disability in people with a type of MS called relapsing remitting MS, and in some people with types called primary and secondary progressive MS, who have relapses. Unfortunately, there's currently no treatment that can slow the progress of primary progressive MS, or secondary progressive MS, where there are no relapses. Many therapies aiming to treat progressive MS are currently being researched.
4;What is the outlook for people with multiple sclerosis?;Multiple sclerosis can be a challenging condition to live with, but new treatments over the past 20 years have considerably improved the quality of life of people with the condition. MS itself is rarely fatal, but complications may arise from severe MS, such as chest or bladder infections, or swallowing difficulties. The average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average, and this gap appears to be getting smaller all the time.
5;Where can I find support and advice for multiple sclerosis?;If you or someone you know has just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, there are 2 main MS charities in the UK: the MS Society and the MS Trust.

Multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that can affect the brain and spinal cord, causing a wide range of potential symptoms, including problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance.
It's a lifelong condition that can sometimes cause serious disability, although it can occasionally be mild.
In many cases, it's possible to treat symptoms. Average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with MS.
It's most commonly diagnosed in people in their 20s, 30s and 40s although it can develop at any age. It's about 2 to 3 times more common in women than men.
MS is one of the most common causes of disability in younger adults.
Symptoms of multiple sclerosis
The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person and can affect any part of the body.
The main symptoms include:
fatigue
difficulty walking
vision problems, such as blurred vision
problems controlling the bladder
numbness or tingling in different parts of the body
muscle stiffness and spasms
problems with balance and co-ordination
problems with thinking, learning and planning
Depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms may come and go in phases or get steadily worse over time (progress).
Getting medical advice
See a GP if you're worried you might have signs of MS.
The symptoms often have many other causes, so they're not necessarily a sign of MS.
Let the GP know about the specific pattern of symptoms you're experiencing.
If they think you could have MS, you'll be referred to a specialist in conditions of the nervous system (a neurologist), who may suggest tests such as an MRI scan to check for features of MS.

Types of multiple sclerosis
MS starts in 1 of 2 general ways: with individual relapses (attacks or exacerbations) or with gradual progression.
Relapsing remitting MS
Between 8 and 9 of every 10 people with MS are diagnosed with the relapsing remitting type.
Someone with relapsing remitting MS will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, known as relapses.
These typically worsen over a few days, last for days to weeks to months, then slowly improve over a similar time period.
Relapses often occur without warning, but are sometimes associated with a period of illness or stress.
The symptoms of a relapse may disappear altogether, with or without treatment, although some symptoms often persist, with repeated attacks happening over several years.
Periods between attacks are known as periods of remission. These can last for years at a time.
After many years (usually decades), many, but not all, people with relapsing remitting MS go on to develop secondary progressive MS.
In this type of MS, symptoms gradually worsen over time without obvious attacks. Some people continue to have infrequent relapses during this stage.
About two-thirds of people with relapsing remitting MS will develop secondary progressive MS.
Primary progressive MS
Between 1 and 2 in every 10 people with the condition start their MS with a gradual worsening of symptoms.
In primary progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and accumulate over several years, and there are no periods of remission, though people often have periods where their condition appears to stabilise.

10,"Patient : Hi, je suis un peu inquiet car j'ai entendu dire que l'hypertension artérielle n'avait pas de symptômes.

AI-Assistant : Bonjour, c'est exact. L'hypertension artérielle est une maladie silencieuse qui ne présente généralement pas de symptômes. C'est pourquoi il est important de la faire contrôler régulièrement.

Patient : Comment peut-on savoir si on souffre d'hypertension artérielle ?

AI-Assistant : La seule façon de savoir si vous avez une tension artérielle élevée est de la faire mesurer. Tous les adultes de plus de 40 ans sont invités à vérifier leur tension artérielle au moins tous les 5 ans. Vous pouvez faire mesurer votre tension artérielle chez votre médecin, dans certaines pharmacies, dans certains lieux de travail et lors de votre bilan de santé NHS. Vous pouvez également surveiller votre tension artérielle vous-même avec un tensiomètre à domicile.

Patient : Quels sont les risques de l'hypertension artérielle ?

AI-Assistant : L'hypertension artérielle augmente le risque de graves problèmes de santé tels que les crises cardiaques, les AVC et les maladies rénales. Cela peut également entraîner des problèmes de santé graves tels que la démence vasculaire, l'anévrisme aortique et l'insuffisance cardiaque.

Patient : Est-ce que la modification du mode de vie peut aider à réduire la tension artérielle ?

AI-Assistant : Oui, modifier votre mode de vie peut vous aider à réduire votre tension artérielle. Réduire la quantité de sel dans votre alimentation, manger des aliments sains et équilibrés, limiter votre consommation d'alcool et faire de l'exercice régulièrement peuvent aider à réduire votre tension artérielle.

Patient : Si mes habitudes de vie sont modifiées mais que ma tension artérielle reste élevée, comment peut-elle être traitée ?

AI-Assistant : Si votre tension artérielle reste élevée malgré des modifications de votre mode de vie, votre médecin peut vous prescrire un ou plusieurs médicaments pour la faire baisser. Ces médicaments sont généralement pris une fois par jour et sont disponibles sous forme de comprimés. Les médicaments couramment utilisés pour abaisser la tension artérielle comprennent les inhibiteurs de l'enzyme de conversion, les bêta-bloquants, les diurétiques et les antagonistes des récepteurs de l'angiotensine II.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,French,0,f4df95ec69,fa8f0069a94baa9b3e44cebb3c7aa5df1531bfab0b1f469b734422a05dbdbe40,"Overview
High blood pressure (hypertension)
High blood pressure, or hypertension, rarely has noticeable symptoms. But if untreated, it increases your risk of serious problems such as heart attacks and strokes.
Around a third of adults in the UK have high blood pressure, although many will not realise it.
The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have your blood pressure checked.
What is high blood pressure?
Blood pressure is recorded with 2 numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body.
The diastolic pressure (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels.
They're both measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg).
As a general guide:
high blood pressure is considered to be from 140/90mmHg (or an average of 135/85mmHg at home) – or 150/90mmHg (or an average of 145/85mmHg at home) if you're over the age of 80
ideal blood pressure is usually considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg, while the target for over-80s is below 150/90mmHg (or 145/85mmHg at home)
Blood pressure readings between 120/80mmHg and 140/90mmHg could mean you're at risk of developing high blood pressure if you do not take steps to keep your blood pressure under control.
Everyone's blood pressure will be slightly different. What's considered low or high for you may be normal for someone else.
Risks of high blood pressure
If your blood pressure is too high, it puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes.
Persistent high blood pressure can increase your risk of a number of serious and potentially life-threatening health conditions, such as:
heart disease
heart attacks
strokes
heart failure
peripheral arterial disease
aortic aneurysms
kidney disease
vascular dementia
If you have high blood pressure, reducing it even a small amount can help lower your risk of these health conditions.
Check your blood pressure
The only way of knowing whether you have high blood pressure is to have a blood pressure test.
All adults over 40 are advised to have their blood pressure checked at least every 5 years.
Getting this done is easy and could save your life.
You can get your blood pressure tested at a number of places, including:
at your GP surgery
at some pharmacies
as part of your NHS Health Check
in some workplaces
You can also check your blood pressure yourself with a home blood pressure monitor.
Find out more about getting a blood pressure test
Things that can increase your risk of getting high blood pressure
It's not always clear what causes high blood pressure, but there are things that can increase your risk.
You might be more at risk if you:
are overweight
eat too much salt and do not eat enough fruit and vegetables
do not do enough exercise
drink too much alcohol or coffee (or other caffeine-based drinks)
smoke
do not get much sleep or have disturbed sleep
are over 65
have a relative with high blood pressure
are of black African or black Caribbean descent
live in a deprived area
Making healthy lifestyle changes can sometimes help reduce your chances of getting high blood pressure and help lower your blood pressure if it's already high.
Treatment for high blood pressure
Doctors can help you keep your blood pressure to a safe level using:
lifestyle changes
medicines
What works best is different for each person.
Talk to your doctor to help you decide about treatment.
This patient decision aid (PDF, 132kb) can also help you to understand your treatment options.
Lifestyle changes to reduce blood pressure
These lifestyle changes can help prevent and lower high blood pressure:
reduce the amount of salt you eat and have a generally healthy diet
cut back on alcohol
lose weight if you're overweight
exercise regularly
cut down on caffeine
stop smoking
Some people with high blood pressure may also need to take 1 or more medicines to stop their blood pressure getting too high.
Medicines for high blood pressure
If you're diagnosed with high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend taking 1 or more medicines to keep it under control.
These come as tablets and usually need to be taken once a day.
Common blood pressure medicines include:
ACE inhibitors – such as enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril
angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) – such as candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, valsartan and olmesartan
calcium channel blockers – such as amlodipine, felodipine and nifedipine or diltiazem and verapamil
diuretics – such as indapamide and bendroflumethiazide
beta blockers – such as atenolol and bisoprolol
alpha blockers – such as doxazosin
other diuretics – such as amiloride and spironolactone
The medicine recommended for you will depend on things like how high your blood pressure is, your age and your ethnicity."
11,"Patient: Salut, j'ai remarqué que mon bébé a des difficultés à respirer et qu'il est agité. Je m'inquiète que ce soit grave.

AI-Assistant: Bonjour, je comprends que vous puissiez être préoccupé par les symptômes que vous décrivez. Puis-je vous poser quelques questions pour mieux comprendre ce qui se passe ?

Patient: Oui, bien sûr.

AI-Assistant: Le nez de votre bébé est-il bouché ou coule-t-il ? A-t-il également de la fièvre ?

Patient: Oui, son nez est bouché et il a une légère fièvre.

AI-Assistant: Ces symptômes peuvent être dus à une infection courante des voies respiratoires supérieures. Il s'agit souvent de symptômes du rhume. Avez-vous remarqué s'il a des difficultés à manger ou à respirer ?

Patient: Oui, il a des difficultés à manger et respire rapidement.

AI-Assistant: Ces symptômes pourraient indiquer une affection appelée bronchiolite. Cette maladie souvent causée par le virus respiratoire syncytial (RSV) est très fréquente chez les enfants de moins de 2 ans. La bonne nouvelle est que la plupart des enfants atteints de bronchiolite guérissent avec le temps. Mais dans certains cas, cela peut être grave.

Patient: Que dois-je faire si les symptômes empirent ?

AI-Assistant: Si votre bébé a des difficultés à respirer, si sa peau, sa langue ou ses lèvres deviennent bleues, s'il est somnolent ou agité, ou si sa respiration s'arrête pendant de longues périodes, vous devez appeler immédiatement les urgences ou vous rendre à une clinique d'urgences. Si vous avez des inquiétudes moins urgentes, demandez un rendez-vous chez votre médecin de famille ou appelez le 111 pour obtenir des conseils sur la marche à suivre. 

Patient: Y a-t-il un traitement pour la bronchiolite?

AI-Assistant: Il n'y a pas de traitement spécifique pour la bronchiolite, mais vous pouvez aider votre bébé à la maison en donnant du paracétamol ou de l'ibuprofène, soit le peu de fluides pour éviter la déshydratation. Évitez de fumer près de votre enfant et ne tentez pas de baisser sa température par des moyens comme l'essuyage avec de l'eau froide.

Patient: Comment puis-je empêcher la bronchiolite de se propager à d'autres membres de la famille?

AI-Assistant: Pour aider à prévenir la propagation de la bronchiolite, lavez-vous les mains régulièrement et les jouets de bébé après utilisation. Selon l'âge de votre bébé, il peut être judicieux de les garder à l'écart des personnes atteintes d'un rhume et de la grippe et d'éviter le contact avec les nourrissons amenant une infection.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,French,0,f4df95ec69,dcfcb544d7d424aac263abef6d832f97613c2228a98db9317f6ec84cc2732975,"Bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is a common chest infection that affects babies and children under 2. It's usually mild and can be treated at home, but it can be serious.
Bronchiolitis is different from bronchitis, which causes a cough with lots of mucus and can affect people of all ages.
Check if it's bronchiolitis
The early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to a cold, such as sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, a cough and a slightly high temperature of 38C.
A child with bronchiolitis may then get other symptoms, such as:
breathing more quickly
finding it difficult to feed or eat
noisy breathing (wheezing)
becoming irritable
Symptoms are usually worst between days 3 and 5, and the cough usually gets better in 3 weeks.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if:
your child is having difficulty breathing – you may notice grunting noises or their tummy sucking under their ribs
there are pauses when your child breathes
your child's skin, tongue or lips are blue
your child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake
As a parent, you may know if your child seems seriously unwell and should trust your own judgement.
Find your nearest A&E
Urgent advice:
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if:
your child has had a cold and it's getting worse
your child is feeding or eating much less than normal
your child has had a dry nappy for 12 hours or more, or shows other signs of dehydration
your baby is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38C, or is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39C or higher
your baby feels hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, or feels sweaty
your child is very tired or irritable
Treatments for bronchiolitis
There's no specific treatment for bronchiolitis. It usually gets better on its own and you can look after your child at home.
But it can be serious in some children, who may need to be treated in hospital.
Do
give children's paracetamol to babies and children over 2 months old or ibuprofen to babies and children over 3 months old – but do not give aspirin to a child under 16
try using salt water (saline) drops if your child's nose is blocked
keep your child upright as much as possible when they're awake – this will help them breathe more easily
encourage your child to drink lots of fluids – try smaller feeds more often in babies, and give older children extra water or diluted fruit juice
Don’t
do not smoke around your child
do not try to lower your child's temperature by sponging them with cool water or taking off all their clothes
Preventing bronchiolitis
There are some things you can do to lower the chances of your child getting bronchiolitis or spreading the viruses that cause it, such as:
wash your hands and your child's hands often
wash or wipe down toys and clean surfaces regularly
use disposable tissues and throw them away as soon as you've used them
keep newborn babies away from anyone with a cold or the flu – especially if they're under 2 months old or were premature
It's also important not to smoke around your child. Children who breathe in cigarette smoke have a higher risk of getting bronchiolitis.
Children at risk of severe bronchiolitis
Some children may have a higher risk of getting seriously ill with bronchiolitis.
This includes children who:
were born very prematurely
have a heart or lung condition
have a weakened immune system
These children may be able to have treatment in the winter (between October and March) to stop them getting severe bronchiolitis.
Causes of bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is caused by a viral infection, usually the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
RSV is very common and spreads easily in coughs and sneezes. Almost all children have had it by the time they're 2.
In older children and adults, RSV may cause a cough or cold, but in young children it can cause bronchiolitis."
12,"Patient: Hi, I have been coughing for a while now, could it be bronchitis?

AI-Assistant: Bonjour! La bronchite est une inflammation des voies respiratoires causée généralement par une infection. Avez-vous d'autres symptômes tels que des douleurs thoraciques en toussant, une respiration courte, ou encore un mal de gorge ?

Patient: Oui, j'ai aussi mal à la poitrine quand je tousse et j'ai du mal à respirer.

AI-Assistant: Je vous suggère de consulter votre médecin généraliste si vous toussez depuis plus de trois semaines. Il vous sera probablement demandé d'uriner dans un gobelet pour des tests.

Bronchitis is inflammation of the airways in the lungs that is usually caused by an infection. It often gets better without treatment in around 3 weeks.
Some people have long-term inflammation of the airways in the lungs called chronic bronchitis. This is known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Check if you have bronchitis
Symptoms of bronchitis can be similar to a cold or flu.
Symptoms include:
a cough – you may cough up clear, white, yellow or green mucus
chest pain when coughing
shortness of breath
a sore throat
a runny nose
a high temperature

Steroids, also called corticosteroids, are anti-inflammatory medicines used to treat a range of conditions.
They're different from anabolic steroids, which are often used illegally by some people to increase their muscle mass.
Types of steroids
Steroids come in many different forms.
The main types are:
tablets, syrups and liquids – such as prednisolone
inhalers – such as beclometasone and fluticasone
nasal sprays – such as beclometasone and fluticasone
injections (given into joints, muscles or blood vessels) – such as methylprednisolone
creams, lotions and gels – such as hydrocortisone skin cream
Most steroids are only available on prescription, but a few (such as some creams or nasal sprays) can be bought from pharmacies and shops.
Side effects of steroids
Steroids do not tend to cause significant side effects if they're taken for a short time or at a low dose.
But sometimes they can cause unpleasant side effects, such as an increased appetite, mood changes and difficulty sleeping. This is most common with steroid tablets.
The side effects will usually pass once you finish the treatment, but do not stop taking your medicine without speaking to your doctor. Stopping a prescribed course of medicine can cause further unpleasant side effects (withdrawal symptoms).
Read more about:
side effects of steroid tablets

You can report any suspected side effect to the Yellow Card Scheme.
Uses for steroids
Steroids can be used to treat a wide range of conditions, including:
asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
hay fever
hives and eczema
painful joints or muscles – such as arthritis, tennis elbow and frozen shoulder
pain caused by an irritated or trapped nerve – such as sciatica
inflammatory bowel disease – such as Crohn's disease
lupus
multiple sclerosis (MS)
How steroids work
Steroids are a man-made version of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands which are 2 small glands found above the kidneys.
When taken in doses higher than the amount your body normally produces, steroids reduce redness and swelling (inflammation). This can help with inflammatory conditions such as asthma and eczema.
Steroids also reduce the activity of the immune system, which is the body's natural defence against illness and infection.
This can help treat autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body."

1;Qu'est-ce que la maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob (MCJ) et quels sont ses symptômes ?;La maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob est une maladie rare et fatale qui affecte le cerveau et qui cause des dommages qui empirent rapidement dans le temps. Les symptômes de la MCJ comprennent : la perte d'intelligence et de mémoire, les changements de personnalité, la perte d'équilibre et de coordination, la difficulté à parler, les problèmes de vision et la cécité, les mouvements de secousse anormaux et la perte progressive de la fonction cérébrale et de la mobilité. La plupart des personnes atteintes de la MCJ décèdent dans l'année qui suit le début des symptômes, généralement d'une infection car l'immobilité causée par la MCJ les rend vulnérables aux infections.
2;Quelles sont les causes de la MCJ ?;La MCJ semble être causée par une protéine infectieuse anormale appelée prion. Ces prions s'accumulent à des niveaux élevés dans le cerveau et provoquent des dommages irréversibles aux cellules nerveuses. Bien que les prions anormaux soient techniquement infectieux, ils sont très différents des virus et des bactéries. Les prions ne sont pas détruits par les extrêmes de chaleur et de radiation utilisés pour tuer les bactéries et les virus, et les antibiotiques ou les médicaments antiviraux n'ont aucun effet sur eux.
3;Quels sont les types de MCJ ?;Il existe 4 types principaux de MCJ. La MCJ sporadique est la plus courante et la cause précise de cette maladie est inconnue. Il a été suggéré que certaines personnes ont une protéine cérébrale normale qui change de manière anormale (""mal se plie"") et se transforme en prion. La MCJ sporadique touche principalement les adultes âgés entre 45 et 75 ans et est très rare, ne touchant qu'une ou deux personnes sur un million chaque année au Royaume-Uni. La MCJ variante peut être causée par la consommation de viande bovine infectée par l'encéphalopathie spongiforme bovine, également connu comme la ""vache folle"". La MCJ familiale est une maladie génétique rare qui est causée par une mutation dans le gène de la protéine prion que l'on hérite d'un parent. La MCJ iatrogène est causée par la transmission involontaire de la maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob lors de traitements médicaux ou chirurgicaux. 
4;Comment est traitée la MCJ ?;Il n'y a actuellement aucun remède pour la maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob, le traitement vise donc à soulager les symptômes et à rendre la personne affectée aussi confortable que possible. Cela peut inclure l'utilisation de médicaments tels que des antidépresseurs pour aider à l'anxiété et à la dépression, et des analgésiques pour soulager la douleur. Certaines personnes auront besoin de soins infirmiers et d'une aide pour se nourrir. Il est important de noter que le traitement ne guérira pas la maladie, mais peut aider à atténuer les symptômes.
5;Existe-t-il un moyen de prévenir la MCJ ?;Il n'y a pas de moyen sûr de prévenir la maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob. Cependant, il est possible de réduire le risque de contracter la maladie en suivant les mesures suivantes: en évitant de manger de la viande contaminée par l'encéphalopathie spongiforme bovine, en observant les pratiques de santé et de sécurité lorsqu'on travaille avec des tissus animaux ou humains dans un environnement médical ou de laboratoire, et en choisissant des sources de transplantations de tissus et d'organes sûres et bien réglementées. En outre, les dons de sang sont strictement réglementés au Royaume-Uni pour limiter le risque de transmission de la maladie de Creutzfeld-Jakob.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,French,0,f53cf99826,2778c4f7a223d3515556c6fd9bd420c64ab4eb9c76066733c00d66908e8bdf33,"Overview
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and fatal condition that affects the brain. It causes brain damage that worsens rapidly over time.
Symptoms of CJD
Symptoms of CJD include:
loss of intellect and memory
changes in personality
loss of balance and co-ordination
slurred speech
vision problems and blindness
abnormal jerking movements
progressive loss of brain function and mobility
Most people with CJD will die within a year of the symptoms starting, usually from infection.
This is because the immobility caused by CJD can make people with the condition vulnerable to infection.
Read more about the symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and diagnosing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
What causes CJD?
CJD appears to be caused by an abnormal infectious protein called a prion. These prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells.
While the abnormal prions are technically infectious, they're very different from viruses and bacteria.
For example, prions aren't destroyed by the extremes of heat and radiation used to kill bacteria and viruses, and antibiotics or antiviral medicines have no effect on them.
Read more about the causes of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Types of CJD
There are 4 main types of CJD.
Sporadic CJD
Sporadic CJD is the most common type.
The precise cause of sporadic CJD is unclear, but it's been suggested that a normal brain protein changes abnormally (""misfolds"") and turns into a prion.
Most cases of sporadic CJD occur in adults aged between 45 and 75. On average, symptoms develop between the ages of 60 and 65.
Despite being the most common type of CJD, sporadic CJD is still very rare, affecting only 1 or 2 people in every million each year in the UK.
In 2020, there were 131 recorded deaths from sporadic CJD in the UK.
Variant CJD
Variant CJD (vCJD) is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or ""mad cow"" disease), a similar prion disease to CJD.
Since the link between variant CJD and BSE was discovered in 1996, strict controls have proved very effective in preventing meat from infected cattle entering the food chain.
See preventing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease for more information.
But the average time it takes for the symptoms of variant CJD to occur after initial infection (the incubation period) is still unclear.
The incubation period could be very long (more than 10 years) in some people, so those exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced can still develop variant CJD.
The prion that causes variant CJD can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, although this has only happened 5 times in the UK.
In 2020, there were no recorded deaths from variant CJD in the UK.
Familial or inherited CJD
Familial CJD is a very rare genetic condition where one of the genes a person inherits from their parent (the prion protein gene) carries a mutation that causes prions to form in their brain during adulthood, triggering the symptoms of CJD.
It affects about 1 in every 9 million people in the UK.
The symptoms of familial CJD usually first develop in people when they're in their early 50s.
In 2020, there were 6 deaths from familial CJD and similar inherited prion diseases in the UK.
Iatrogenic CJD
Iatrogenic CJD is where the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment.
For example, a common cause of iatrogenic CJD in the past was growth hormone treatment using human pituitary growth hormones extracted from deceased individuals, some of whom were infected with CJD.
Synthetic versions of human growth hormone have been used since 1985, so this is no longer a risk.
Iatrogenic CJD can also occur if instruments used during brain surgery on a person with CJD aren't properly cleaned between each surgical procedure and are reused on another person.
But increased awareness of these risks means iatrogenic CJD is now very rare.
In 2020, there was 1 death from iatrogenic CJD in the UK caused by receiving human growth hormone before 1985.
How CJD is treated
There's currently no cure for CJD, so treatment aims to relieve symptoms and make the affected person feel as comfortable as possible.
This can include using medicine such as antidepressants to help with anxiety and depression, and painkillers to relieve pain.
Some people will need nursing care and assistance with feeding.

Variant CJD compensation scheme
In October 2001, the government announced a compensation scheme for UK victims of variant CJD.
The vCJD Trust assesses claims and pays compensation to victims and their families."

Il est également important d'éviter les déclencheurs tels que les savons et les détergents, ainsi que de gérer le stress et l'environnement pour aider à réduire les symptômes de l'eczéma.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,French,0,f53cf99826,fe2e393a80b5687e0c8370385988ad8b9a355130683c598a187dcc8e62966174,"Overview
Atopic eczema
Atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most common form of eczema, a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, dry and cracked.
Atopic eczema is more common in children, often developing before their first birthday. But it may also develop for the first time in adults.
It's usually a long-term (chronic) condition, although it can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older.
Symptoms of atopic eczema
Atopic eczema causes the skin to become itchy, dry, cracked and sore.
Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread inflamed skin all over the body.
Inflamed skin can become red on lighter skin, and darker brown, purple or grey on darker skin. This can also be more difficult to see on darker skin.
Although atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, it most often affects the hands, insides of the elbows, backs of the knees and the face and scalp in children.
People with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups).
When to seek medical advice
See a GP if you have symptoms of atopic eczema. They'll usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions, such as:
whether the rash is itchy and where it appears
when the symptoms first began
whether it comes and goes over time
whether there's a history of atopic eczema in your family
whether you have any other conditions, such as allergies or asthma
whether something in your diet or lifestyle may be contributing to your symptoms
Typically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and 3 or more of the following:
visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin – such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional
a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above
generally dry skin in the last 12 months
a history of asthma or hay fever – children under 4 must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has 1 of these conditions
the condition started before the age of 2 (this does not apply to children under the age of 4)
Causes of atopic eczema
The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it's clear it is not down to one single thing.
Atopic eczema often occurs in people who get allergies. ""Atopic"" means sensitivity to allergens.
It can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever.
The symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather.
Sometimes food allergies can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema.
You may be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse.
Allergy tests are not usually needed, although they're sometimes helpful in identifying whether a food allergy may be triggering symptoms.
Treating atopic eczema
Treatment for atopic eczema can help to relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time.
But there's currently no cure and severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life, which may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally.
There's also an increased risk of skin infections.
Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including:
self-care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers
emollients (moisturising treatments) – used on a daily basis for dry skin
topical corticosteroids – used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups
Other types of eczema
Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin.
Other types of eczema include:
discoid eczema – a type of eczema that occurs in circular or oval patches on the skin
contact dermatitis – a type of eczema that occurs when the body comes into contact with a particular substance
varicose eczema – a type of eczema that most often affects the lower legs and is caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins
seborrhoeic eczema – a type of eczema where red, scaly patches develop on the sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears and scalp
dyshidrotic eczema (pompholyx) – a type of eczema that causes tiny blisters to erupt across the palms of the hands"

1;Comment est-ce que le VIH endommage le système immunitaire ?;Le VIH (virus de l'immunodéficience humaine) infecte les cellules du système immunitaire et les détruit progressivement, réduisant ainsi la capacité du corps à lutter contre les infections et les maladies. Cela se produit car le VIH se reproduit dans les cellules CD4, qui sont un type de globules blancs responsables de la protection de l'organisme contre les infections. Le virus profite ensuite de ces cellules pour se répliquer et former de nouveaux virus, entraînant finalement la destruction des cellules CD4 et la diminution de la quantité de ces cellules dans le sang. En conséquence, le système immunitaire s'affaiblit avec le temps, laissant l'organisme vulnérable aux infections et aux maladies opportunistes.
2;Comment peut-on détecter le VIH ?;La seule façon de savoir si vous êtes infecté par le VIH est de passer un test de dépistage du VIH. Ce test implique la collecte d'un échantillon de sang ou de salive pour détecter les signes d'infection. Les tests de dépistage de la clinique peuvent fournir des résultats en quelques minutes, mais il faut parfois quelques jours pour obtenir les résultats d'un test de dépistage plus approfondi. Des kits d'auto-prélèvement à domicile sont également disponibles pour l'achat en ligne ou en pharmacie. Si un premier test suggère que vous êtes séropositif, un deuxième test sanguin sera nécessaire pour confirmer le résultat. Si ce deuxième test est également positif, vous serez orienté vers une clinique spécialisée pour d'autres tests et un traitement.
3;Comment peut-on prévenir l'infection par le VIH ?;Il existe de nombreuses façons efficaces de prévenir ou de réduire le risque d'infection par le VIH, notamment: utiliser un préservatif pendant les rapports sexuels, utilisant la prophylaxie post-exposition (PEP), utilisant le traitement pré-exposition (PrEP), suivant un traitement pour réduire la charge virale à indétectable, si vous utilisez des drogues, ne jamais partager les aiguilles et autres équipements d'injection, y compris les seringues, les cuillères et les tampons. Parlez à votre clinique de santé sexuelle locale ou à un médecin pour obtenir des conseils sur la meilleure façon de réduire votre risque.
4;Comment le VIH peut-il être transmis d'une personne à l'autre ?;Le VIH se trouve dans les fluides corporels d'une personne infectée. Cela comprend le sperme, les fluides vaginaux et anaux, le sang et le lait maternel. Le VIH ne peut pas être transmis par la sueur, l'urine ou la salive. La façon la plus courante de contracter le VIH au Royaume-Uni est d'avoir des rapports sexuels anaux ou vaginaux sans préservatif. Les autres moyens de transmission du VIH incluent: le partage d'aiguilles, de seringues ou d'autres équipements d'injection, la transmission de la mère à l'enfant pendant la grossesse, l'accouchement ou l'allaitement. Le risque de contracter le VIH par le sexe oral est très faible et dépendra de nombreux facteurs, tels que le fait de recevoir ou de donner une fellation, et de l'hygiène buccale de la personne qui donne la fellation.
5;Quels sont les objectifs du traitement contre le VIH ?;Le but du traitement du VIH est d'arriver à une charge virale indétectable. Cela signifie que le niveau de virus du VIH dans votre corps est assez faible pour ne pas être détecté par un test. Les médicaments antirétroviraux sont utilisés pour traiter le VIH. Ils fonctionnent en empêchant la réplication du virus dans le corps, permettant au système immunitaire de se réparer et en prévenant les dommages supplémentaires. Ces médicaments se présentent sous forme de comprimés, qui doivent être pris chaque jour. La prise d'une combinaison de différents médicaments rend beaucoup moins probable le développement d'une résistance. La plupart des personnes atteintes du VIH prennent une combinaison de médicaments. Il est essentiel de prendre ces médicaments tous les jours conformément aux instructions de votre médecin. Si vous vivez avec le VIH, le fait de prendre un traitement efficace et d'avoir un viral indétectable réduit considérablement votre risque de transmettre le VIH à d'autres personnes.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,French,0,f53cf99826,cc1fe083da4fc5ee9d81dd0500fee78c778c3dd317f958d9de4fabb73c86031f,"Overview
HIV and AIDS
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system and weakens your ability to fight everyday infections and disease.
AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus.
While AIDS cannot be transmitted from 1 person to another, the HIV virus can.
There's currently no cure for HIV, but there are very effective drug treatments that enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life.
With an early diagnosis and effective treatments, most people with HIV will not develop any AIDS-related illnesses and will live a near-normal lifespan.
Symptoms of HIV infection
Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after HIV infection, which lasts for a week or 2.
After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years, although the virus continues to damage your immune system.
This means many people with HIV do not know they're infected.
Anyone who thinks they could have HIV should get tested.
Some people are advised to have regular tests as they're at particularly high risk.
Read more about who's most at risk of HIV
Causes of HIV infection
HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person. This includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood and breast milk.
It's a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long.
HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat, urine or saliva.
The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through having anal or vaginal sex without a condom.
Other ways of getting HIV include:
sharing needles, syringes or other injecting equipment
transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding
The chance of getting HIV through oral sex is very low and will be dependent on many things, such as whether you receive or give oral sex and the oral hygiene of the person giving the oral sex.
Diagnosing HIV
Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV.
You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities.
Find HIV testing services near you
The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection.
It's important to be aware that:
emergency anti-HIV medicine called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may stop you becoming infected if started within 72 hours of possible exposure to the virus – it's recommended that you start it as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours
an early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the virus, reduce the risk of becoming more unwell and reduce the chance of passing the virus on to others
Both positive and negative HIV tests may need to be repeated 1 to 3 months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the window period), but you should not wait this long to seek help:
clinics may offer a finger prick blood test, which can give you a result in minutes, but it may take up to a few days to get the results of a more detailed HIV test
home testing or home sampling kits are available to buy online or from pharmacies – depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few days
If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result.
If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options.
Treatment for HIV
Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage.
These come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day.
HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV medicine very easily, but taking a combination of different medicines makes this much less likely.
Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines. It's vital these are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.
The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load. This means the level of HIV virus in your body is low enough to not be detected by a test.
Living with HIV
If you're living with HIV, taking effective HIV treatment and being undetectable significantly reduces your risk of passing HIV on to others.
You'll also be encouraged to:
take regular exercise
eat a healthy diet
stop smoking
have yearly flu jabs to minimise the risk of getting serious illnesses
Without treatment, the immune system will become severely damaged, and life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and severe infections can occur.
If you're planning on getting pregnant, it's important to talk to a GP. Although rare, it's possible to transmit HIV to your baby.
Preventing HIV
Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV infection.
There are many effective ways to prevent or reduce the risk of HIV infection, including:
using a condom for sex
post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
treatment for HIV to reduce the viral load to undetectable
if you use drugs, never sharing needles or other injecting equipment, including syringes, spoons and swabs
Speak to your local sexual health clinic or a GP for further advice about the best way to reduce your risk.
For people with HIV, if you have been taking effective HIV treatment and your viral load has been undetectable for 6 months or more, it means you cannot pass the virus on through sex.
This is called undetectable=untransmittable (U=U).

17,"Patient: Salut !
AI-Assistant: Bonjour ! Comment puis-je vous aider ?
Patient: J'ai entendu parler d'une crise cardiaque, c'est quoi exactement ?
AI-Assistant: Une crise cardiaque est une urgence médicale sérieuse pendant laquelle l'approvisionnement en sang vers le cœur est soudainement bloqué, généralement par un caillot sanguin. Cela peut causer des dommages importants au muscle cardiaque et peut être mortel.
Patient: Quels sont les symptômes d'une crise cardiaque ?
AI-Assistant: Les symptômes d'une crise cardiaque peuvent inclure une douleur à la poitrine (pression, lourdeur, resserrement ou pression), une douleur dans d'autres parties du corps, comme les bras (surtout le bras gauche), la mâchoire, le cou, le dos et le ventre. D'autres symptômes peuvent inclure des étourdissements, des sueurs, un essoufflement, des nausées et des vomissements.
Patient: Quand devrais-je appeler une ambulance en cas de suspicion de crise cardiaque ?
AI-Assistant: Une crise cardiaque est une urgence médicale. Vous devriez appeler le 15 tout de suite si vous pensez que vous ou quelqu'un d'autre est en train de faire une crise cardiaque. Plus vous agissez vite, meilleures seront les chances de récupération.
Patient: Comment peut-on prévenir une crise cardiaque ?
AI-Assistant: Il existe 5 étapes principales que vous pouvez suivre pour réduire votre risque de crise cardiaque (ou d'une autre crise cardiaque) : arrêter de fumer, perdre du poids si vous êtes en surpoids ou obèse, faire de l'exercice régulièrement (au moins 150 minutes d'activité aérobie d'intensité modérée par semaine), manger une alimentation faible en gras et riche en fibres, y compris des grains entiers et au moins cinq portions de fruits et légumes par jour, et modérer votre consommation d'alcool.
Patient: Comment traite-t-on une crise cardiaque ?
AI-Assistant: Pendant que vous attendez une ambulance, il peut être utile de mâcher puis d'avaler un comprimé d'aspirine (idéalement 300 mg), à condition que la personne ayant une crise cardiaque ne soit pas allergique à l'aspirine. Le traitement de la crise cardiaque à l'hôpital dépend de la gravité de la crise. Les deux principaux traitements sont l'utilisation de médicaments pour dissoudre les caillots sanguins et la chirurgie pour aider à rétablir la circulation sanguine vers le coeur.
Patient: Y a-t-il des complications liées à une crise cardiaque ?
AI-Assistant: Oui, les complications liées à une crise cardiaque peuvent être graves et potentiellement mortelles. Elles peuvent inclure des dysrythmies (battements cardiaques anormaux), un choc cardiogénique (où les muscles cardiaques sont gravement endommagés), et la rupture du muscle cardiaque lui-même.

Heart attack
A heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI) is a serious medical emergency in which the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked, usually by a blood clot.
A heart attack is a medical emergency. Call 999 and ask for an ambulance if you suspect a heart attack.
A lack of blood to the heart may seriously damage the heart muscle and can be life threatening.
Symptoms of a heart attack
Symptoms of a heart attack can include:
chest pain – a feeling of pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across your chest
pain in other parts of the body – it can feel as if the pain is spreading from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and tummy
feeling lightheaded or dizzy
sweating
shortness of breath
feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)
an overwhelming feeling of anxiety (similar to a panic attack)
coughing or wheezing
The chest pain is often severe, but some people may only experience minor pain, similar to indigestion.
While the most common symptom in both men and women is chest pain, women are more likely to have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, feeling or being sick and back or jaw pain.
Call 999 immediately if you think someone might be having a heart attack. The faster you act, the better their chances.
Treating heart attacks
While waiting for an ambulance, it may help to chew and then swallow a tablet of aspirin (ideally 300mg), as long as the person having a heart attack is not allergic to aspirin.
Aspirin helps to thin the blood and improves blood flow to the heart.
In hospital, treatment for a heart attack depends on how serious it is.
The 2 main treatments are:
using medicines to dissolve blood clots
surgery to help restore blood to the heart
Causes of a heart attack
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart attacks.
CHD is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart get clogged with deposits of cholesterol, known as plaques.
Before a heart attack, 1 of the plaques bursts (ruptures), causing a blood clot to develop at the site of the rupture.
The clot may block the supply of blood to the heart, triggering a heart attack.
Recovering from a heart attack
The time it takes to recover from a heart attack will depend on the amount of damage to your heart muscle.
Most people can return to work after having a heart attack. Some people are well enough to return to work after 2 weeks. Other people may take several months to recover. How quickly you can go back to work depends on your health, the state of your heart and the type of work you do.
The recovery process aims to:
reduce your risk of another heart attack through a combination of lifestyle changes (such as eating a healthy diet), and medicines (such as statins), which help to lower blood cholesterol levels
gradually restore your physical fitness so you can resume normal activities (cardiac rehabilitation)
Find out more about recovering from a heart attack
Complications of a heart attack
Complications of a heart attack can be serious and possibly life threatening.
These include:
arrhythmias – these are abnormal heartbeats. 1 type is where the heart begins beating faster and faster, then stops beating (cardiac arrest)
cardiogenic shock – where the heart's muscles are severely damaged and can no longer contract properly to supply enough blood to maintain many body functions
heart rupture – where the heart's muscles, walls or valves split apart (rupture)
These complications can happen quickly after a heart attack and are a leading cause of death.
Many people die suddenly from a complication of a heart attack before reaching hospital or within the 1st month after a heart attack.
The outlook often depends on:
age – serious complications are more likely as you get older
the severity of the heart attack – how much of the heart's muscle has been damaged during the attack
how long it took before a person received treatment – treatment for a heart attack should begin as soon as possible
Find out more about complications of a heart attack
Preventing a heart attack
There are 5 main steps you can take to reduce your risk of having a heart attack (or having another heart attack):
smokers should quit smoking
lose weight if you're overweight or obese
do regular exercise – adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week, unless advised otherwise by the doctor in charge of your care
eat a low-fat, high-fibre diet, including wholegrains and at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day
moderate your alcohol consumption

Laryngitis is when your voice box or vocal cords in the throat become irritated or swollen. It usually goes away by itself within 1 to 2 weeks.
Check if you have laryngitis
Laryngitis usually comes on suddenly and gets worse during the first 3 days.
The main symptoms are:
a hoarse (croaky) voice
sometimes losing your voice
an irritating cough that does not go away
always needing to clear your throat
a sore throat
Children can also:
have a temperature of 38C or above
be off their food or drink
have difficulty breathing (but this is rare)
Laryngitis is often linked to other illnesses, such as colds and flu, so you may also have other symptoms.
If you're not sure it's laryngitis, check other sore throat symptoms.
How you can treat laryngitis yourself
Laryngitis usually goes away on its own after 1 to 2 weeks and you do not need to see a GP.
Do
try to speak as little as possible
drink plenty of fluids
keep the air moist by putting out bowls of water – central heating and air conditioning make the air dry
gargle with warm salty water (children should not try this)
Don’t
do not talk loudly or whisper – both strain your voice
do not smoke
do not spend time in smoky or dusty places
do not drink too much caffeine or alcohol – they cause dehydration
How to gargle with salty water
Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water. Warm water helps salt dissolve.
Gargle with the solution then spit it out. Do not swallow it.
Repeat as often as you like.
This is not suitable for younger children.
A pharmacist can help with laryngitis
Speak to a pharmacist about your sore throat.
They can give advice and suggest treatments, including:
paracetamol or ibuprofen
cough syrup to help with your cough
solutions to gargle or lozenges for the pain
Find a pharmacy
Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
your symptoms do not improve after 2 weeks
it's very painful or it's difficult to swallow
you keep getting laryngitis or voice problems
What happens at your appointment
The GP will try to work out what has caused your laryngitis.
They may:
look inside your throat using a small mirror
wipe a cotton bud around the back of your throat for testing
arrange a blood test
refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist (if you keep getting laryngitis)
If your laryngitis is caused by an infection, the GP might prescribe antibiotics.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if:
you or your child are having difficulty breathing
Find your nearest A&E
What causes laryngitis
Laryngitis usually happens when you have an infection from a virus, such as cold or flu. A flu vaccination will help prevent you getting flu.
Other things that cause laryngitis include:
allergies to things like dust and fumes
acid from your stomach coming up your throat (acid reflux)
coughing over a long time
clearing your throat all the time"

C'est une maladie qui dure toute la vie et entraîne parfois une incapacité grave, bien qu'elle puisse être parfois légère. Dans de nombreux cas, il est possible de traiter les symptômes.
2;Quels sont les symptômes de la sclérose en plaques ?;Les symptômes de la sclérose en plaques varient largement d'une personne à l'autre et peuvent affecter n'importe quelle partie du corps. Les principaux symptômes sont la fatigue, la difficulté à marcher, des problèmes de vision tels que la vision floue, des problèmes de contrôle de la vessie, des engourdissements ou des picotements dans différentes parties du corps, une rigidité musculaire et des spasmes, des problèmes d'équilibre et de coordination ainsi que des problèmes de réflexion, d'apprentissage et de planification.
3;Comment diagnostiquer la sclérose en plaques ?;Si vous êtes préoccupé par des signes de sclérose en plaques, vous devez consulter votre médecin généraliste. Les symptômes ont souvent de nombreuses autres causes, donc ce ne sont pas nécessairement des signes de sclérose en plaques. Si le médecin pense que vous pourriez avoir la SEP, il vous référera à un spécialiste des troubles du système nerveux (neurologue), qui pourra vous proposer des tests tels qu'une IRM pour rechercher des caractéristiques de la SEP.
4;Comment traite-t-on la sclérose en plaques ?;Il n'y a actuellement pas de cure pour la sclérose en plaques, mais un certain nombre de traitements peuvent aider à contrôler la maladie et à soulager les symptômes. Le traitement dont vous avez besoin dépendra des symptômes et des difficultés spécifiques que vous rencontrez. Il peut inclure le traitement des rechutes avec de courtes séances de médicaments stéroïdiens pour accélérer la guérison, des traitements spécifiques pour les symptômes individuels de la SEP, ainsi que des traitements pour réduire le nombre de rechutes à l'aide de médicaments appelés thérapies modifiant la maladie. Les thérapies modifiant la maladie peuvent également contribuer à ralentir ou à réduire l'aggravation globale de l'invalidité chez les personnes atteintes de la forme récurrente-rémittente de la SEP, ainsi que chez certaines personnes atteintes de formes appelées SEP primaire et secondairement progressives.

Multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that can affect the brain and spinal cord, causing a wide range of potential symptoms, including problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance.
It's a lifelong condition that can sometimes cause serious disability, although it can occasionally be mild.
In many cases, it's possible to treat symptoms. Average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with MS.
It's most commonly diagnosed in people in their 20s, 30s and 40s although it can develop at any age. It's about 2 to 3 times more common in women than men.
MS is one of the most common causes of disability in younger adults.
Symptoms of multiple sclerosis
The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person and can affect any part of the body.
The main symptoms include:
fatigue
difficulty walking
vision problems, such as blurred vision
problems controlling the bladder
numbness or tingling in different parts of the body
muscle stiffness and spasms
problems with balance and co-ordination
problems with thinking, learning and planning
Depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms may come and go in phases or get steadily worse over time (progress).
Getting medical advice
See a GP if you're worried you might have signs of MS.
The symptoms often have many other causes, so they're not necessarily a sign of MS.
Let the GP know about the specific pattern of symptoms you're experiencing.
If they think you could have MS, you'll be referred to a specialist in conditions of the nervous system (a neurologist), who may suggest tests such as an MRI scan to check for features of MS.

Types of multiple sclerosis
MS starts in 1 of 2 general ways: with individual relapses (attacks or exacerbations) or with gradual progression.
Relapsing remitting MS
Between 8 and 9 of every 10 people with MS are diagnosed with the relapsing remitting type.
Someone with relapsing remitting MS will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, known as relapses.
These typically worsen over a few days, last for days to weeks to months, then slowly improve over a similar time period.
Relapses often occur without warning, but are sometimes associated with a period of illness or stress.
The symptoms of a relapse may disappear altogether, with or without treatment, although some symptoms often persist, with repeated attacks happening over several years.
Periods between attacks are known as periods of remission. These can last for years at a time.
After many years (usually decades), many, but not all, people with relapsing remitting MS go on to develop secondary progressive MS.
In this type of MS, symptoms gradually worsen over time without obvious attacks. Some people continue to have infrequent relapses during this stage.
About two-thirds of people with relapsing remitting MS will develop secondary progressive MS.
Primary progressive MS
Between 1 and 2 in every 10 people with the condition start their MS with a gradual worsening of symptoms.
In primary progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and accumulate over several years, and there are no periods of remission, though people often have periods where their condition appears to stabilise.
What causes multiple sclerosis?
MS is an autoimmune condition. This is when something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks a healthy part of the body – in this case, the brain or spinal cord of the nervous system.
In MS, the immune system attacks the layer that surrounds and protects the nerves called the myelin sheath.
This damages and scars the sheath, and potentially the underlying nerves, meaning that messages travelling along the nerves become slowed or disrupted.
Exactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is unclear, but most experts think a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved.
Treatments for multiple sclerosis
There's currently no cure for MS, but a number of treatments can help control the condition and ease symptoms.
The treatment you need will depend on the specific symptoms and difficulties you have.
It may include:
treating relapses with short courses of steroid medicine to speed up recovery
specific treatments for individual MS symptoms
treatment to reduce the number of relapses using medicines called disease-modifying therapies
Disease-modifying therapies may also help to slow or reduce the overall worsening of disability in people with a type of MS called relapsing remitting MS, and in some people with types called primary and secondary progressive MS, who have relapses.
Unfortunately, there's currently no treatment that can slow the progress of primary progressive MS, or secondary progressive MS, where there are no relapses.
Many therapies aiming to treat progressive MS are currently being researched.
Living with multiple sclerosis
If you have been diagnosed with MS, it's important to take care of your general health.

Outlook
MS can be a challenging condition to live with, but new treatments over the past 20 years have considerably improved the quality of life of people with the condition.
MS itself is rarely fatal, but complications may arise from severe MS, such as chest or bladder infections, or swallowing difficulties.
The average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average, and this gap appears to be getting smaller all the time.
Charities and support groups for multiple sclerosis
There are 2 main MS charities in the UK:
MS Society
MS Trust
These organisations offer useful advice, publications, news items about ongoing research, blogs and chatrooms.
They can be very useful if you, or someone you know, has just been diagnosed with MS.
There's also the shift.ms website, an online community for younger people affected by MS.

High blood pressure (hypertension)
High blood pressure, or hypertension, rarely has noticeable symptoms. But if untreated, it increases your risk of serious problems such as heart attacks and strokes.
Around a third of adults in the UK have high blood pressure, although many will not realise it.
The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have your blood pressure checked.
What is high blood pressure?
Blood pressure is recorded with 2 numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body.
The diastolic pressure (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels.
They're both measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg).
As a general guide:
high blood pressure is considered to be from 140/90mmHg (or an average of 135/85mmHg at home) – or 150/90mmHg (or an average of 145/85mmHg at home) if you're over the age of 80
ideal blood pressure is usually considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg, while the target for over-80s is below 150/90mmHg (or 145/85mmHg at home)
Blood pressure readings between 120/80mmHg and 140/90mmHg could mean you're at risk of developing high blood pressure if you do not take steps to keep your blood pressure under control.
Everyone's blood pressure will be slightly different. What's considered low or high for you may be normal for someone else.
Risks of high blood pressure
If your blood pressure is too high, it puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes.
Persistent high blood pressure can increase your risk of a number of serious and potentially life-threatening health conditions, such as:
heart disease
heart attacks
strokes
heart failure
peripheral arterial disease
aortic aneurysms
kidney disease
vascular dementia
If you have high blood pressure, reducing it even a small amount can help lower your risk of these health conditions.
Check your blood pressure
The only way of knowing whether you have high blood pressure is to have a blood pressure test.
All adults over 40 are advised to have their blood pressure checked at least every 5 years.
Getting this done is easy and could save your life.
You can get your blood pressure tested at a number of places, including:
at your GP surgery
at some pharmacies
as part of your NHS Health Check
in some workplaces
You can also check your blood pressure yourself with a home blood pressure monitor.
Find out more about getting a blood pressure test
Things that can increase your risk of getting high blood pressure
It's not always clear what causes high blood pressure, but there are things that can increase your risk.
You might be more at risk if you:
are overweight
eat too much salt and do not eat enough fruit and vegetables
do not do enough exercise
drink too much alcohol or coffee (or other caffeine-based drinks)
smoke
do not get much sleep or have disturbed sleep
are over 65
have a relative with high blood pressure
are of black African or black Caribbean descent
live in a deprived area
Making healthy lifestyle changes can sometimes help reduce your chances of getting high blood pressure and help lower your blood pressure if it's already high.
Treatment for high blood pressure
Doctors can help you keep your blood pressure to a safe level using:
lifestyle changes
medicines
What works best is different for each person.
Talk to your doctor to help you decide about treatment.
This patient decision aid (PDF, 132kb) can also help you to understand your treatment options.
Lifestyle changes to reduce blood pressure
These lifestyle changes can help prevent and lower high blood pressure:
reduce the amount of salt you eat and have a generally healthy diet
cut back on alcohol
lose weight if you're overweight
exercise regularly
cut down on caffeine
stop smoking
Some people with high blood pressure may also need to take 1 or more medicines to stop their blood pressure getting too high.
Medicines for high blood pressure
If you're diagnosed with high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend taking 1 or more medicines to keep it under control.
These come as tablets and usually need to be taken once a day.
Common blood pressure medicines include:
ACE inhibitors – such as enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril
angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) – such as candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, valsartan and olmesartan
calcium channel blockers – such as amlodipine, felodipine and nifedipine or diltiazem and verapamil
diuretics – such as indapamide and bendroflumethiazide
beta blockers – such as atenolol and bisoprolol
alpha blockers – such as doxazosin
other diuretics – such as amiloride and spironolactone
The medicine recommended for you will depend on things like how high your blood pressure is, your age and your ethnicity."

1;What is bronchiolitis and who does it affect?;Bronchiolitis is a chest infection that commonly affects babies and children under 2 years old. It is caused by a viral infection, usually the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It is usually mild and can be treated at home, but it can be serious in some cases. 
2;What are the symptoms of bronchiolitis?;The early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to a cold and include runny or blocked nose, cough, and slightly high temperature. Later symptoms that may develop in some children include breathing more quickly, finding it difficult to feed or eat, noisy breathing (wheezing), and becoming irritable. These symptoms are usually worst between days 3 and 5, and the cough typically gets better in 3 weeks. 
3;What actions should be taken in case of emergency related to bronchiolitis?;In severe cases of bronchiolitis, immediate medical attention is required. Call 999 or go to A&E if your child is having difficulty breathing, pauses when breathing, has blue skin, tongue, or lips, or is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake. As a parent, you should trust your judgment if you feel your child is seriously unwell. 
4;What are some treatments for bronchiolitis?;There is no specific treatment for bronchiolitis. It usually gets better on its own, and you can look after your child at home with supportive care. For example, you can give them children's paracetamol or ibuprofen, try using saline drops, keep them upright as much as possible, and encourage them to drink lots of fluids. However, some children who have severe bronchiolitis may need treatment in the hospital. 
5;How can bronchiolitis be prevented?;There are several things parents and caregivers can do to help prevent bronchiolitis. Wash your hands and your child's hands often, wash or wipe down toys and clean surfaces regularly, use disposable tissues and throw them away as soon as you’ve used them. Additionally, keep newborn babies away from anyone with a cold or the flu, especially if they're under two months old or were premature. Finally, it is important not to smoke around children as those who breathe in cigarette smoke have a higher risk of getting bronchiolitis.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,1,f53cf99826,7f3bed504d374b669525a5450819bb6ea280f7d0983abb1943b738e895879dd0,"Bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is a common chest infection that affects babies and children under 2. It's usually mild and can be treated at home, but it can be serious.
Bronchiolitis is different from bronchitis, which causes a cough with lots of mucus and can affect people of all ages.
Check if it's bronchiolitis
The early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to a cold, such as sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, a cough and a slightly high temperature of 38C.
A child with bronchiolitis may then get other symptoms, such as:
breathing more quickly
finding it difficult to feed or eat
noisy breathing (wheezing)
becoming irritable
Symptoms are usually worst between days 3 and 5, and the cough usually gets better in 3 weeks.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if:
your child is having difficulty breathing – you may notice grunting noises or their tummy sucking under their ribs
there are pauses when your child breathes
your child's skin, tongue or lips are blue
your child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake
As a parent, you may know if your child seems seriously unwell and should trust your own judgement.
Find your nearest A&E
Urgent advice:
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if:
your child has had a cold and it's getting worse
your child is feeding or eating much less than normal
your child has had a dry nappy for 12 hours or more, or shows other signs of dehydration
your baby is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38C, or is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39C or higher
your baby feels hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, or feels sweaty
your child is very tired or irritable
Treatments for bronchiolitis
There's no specific treatment for bronchiolitis. It usually gets better on its own and you can look after your child at home.
But it can be serious in some children, who may need to be treated in hospital.
Do
give children's paracetamol to babies and children over 2 months old or ibuprofen to babies and children over 3 months old – but do not give aspirin to a child under 16
try using salt water (saline) drops if your child's nose is blocked
keep your child upright as much as possible when they're awake – this will help them breathe more easily
encourage your child to drink lots of fluids – try smaller feeds more often in babies, and give older children extra water or diluted fruit juice
Don’t
do not smoke around your child
do not try to lower your child's temperature by sponging them with cool water or taking off all their clothes
Preventing bronchiolitis
There are some things you can do to lower the chances of your child getting bronchiolitis or spreading the viruses that cause it, such as:
wash your hands and your child's hands often
wash or wipe down toys and clean surfaces regularly
use disposable tissues and throw them away as soon as you've used them
keep newborn babies away from anyone with a cold or the flu – especially if they're under 2 months old or were premature
It's also important not to smoke around your child. Children who breathe in cigarette smoke have a higher risk of getting bronchiolitis.
Children at risk of severe bronchiolitis
Some children may have a higher risk of getting seriously ill with bronchiolitis.
This includes children who:
were born very prematurely
have a heart or lung condition
have a weakened immune system
These children may be able to have treatment in the winter (between October and March) to stop them getting severe bronchiolitis.
Causes of bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is caused by a viral infection, usually the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
RSV is very common and spreads easily in coughs and sneezes. Almost all children have had it by the time they're 2.
In older children and adults, RSV may cause a cough or cold, but in young children it can cause bronchiolitis."

23,"ID;Question;Answer
1;What are steroids and what are they used for?;Steroids are anti-inflammatory medications also known as corticosteroids that are used to treat a variety of conditions, such as asthma, eczema, arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis, among others. They work by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune system, depending on the condition being treated. Steroids come in different forms like tablets, inhalers, nasal sprays, injections, creams, lotions, and gels, which can be obtained with a prescription, but some creams and nasal sprays can be purchased over-the-counter.
2;What are the side effects of using steroids?;Steroids at low doses and short-term use have minimal side effects, but some people might experience appetite increase, mood swings, difficulty sleeping, and digestive problems. Consistently high doses or long-term use might also lead to cataracts, weight gain, hypertension, osteoporosis, and increased risk of infections or diabetes. It's essential to consult with a physician about the right dosage and duration to minimize potential side effects. Abruptly stopping the medication can cause withdrawal symptoms, which can also be severe, so it's critical to follow the physician's instructions.
3;What is the difference between corticosteroids and anabolic steroids?;Corticosteroids are medication used to treat medical conditions that cause inflammation while anabolic steroids are synthetic hormones that mimic testosterone and are often abused for performance-enhancing purposes, bulking up, and muscle building. Anabolic steroids are illegal in most countries, unlike corticosteroids, which can only be obtained through a prescription. They also have different effects on the body, creating opposite hormonal responses, and can lead to a wide range of adverse side effects when taken in the wrong dosage or duration.
4;How do steroids work to reduce inflammation and treat autoimmune conditions?;Steroids are artificially formulated to mimic hormones produced by the adrenal glands, which are usually in the form of cortisol. These hormones play a crucial role in regulating inflammation and the immune system's natural response to infections and injuries. Steroids work by reducing redness and swelling (inflammation) and suppressing the immune system's reaction, which can cause autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, among others. By lowering the immune system's activity, steroids help prevent the body from attacking itself and managing inflammation-related symptoms more effectively.
5;What are the different types of steroids and how are they administered?;Steroids come in various forms, depending on the type and severity of medical conditions being treated. They can be inhaled through devices like inhalers or nasal sprays, taken orally in the form of tablets or liquids, injected directly into muscles, joints, or bloodstream, or applied topically through creams, lotions, or gels. Some common types of steroids include prednisolone, beclometasone, fluticasone, and methylprednisolone, among others. The type and way of administration depend on the individual's condition, age, and medical history, and require a doctor's prescription and supervision.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,1,f53cf99826,78ad432d7ce8aee097f08ffad190a8cf9619ff73bf3d53c25f761ebe96df6537,"Steroids
Steroids, also called corticosteroids, are anti-inflammatory medicines used to treat a range of conditions.
They're different from anabolic steroids, which are often used illegally by some people to increase their muscle mass.
Types of steroids
Steroids come in many different forms.
The main types are:
tablets, syrups and liquids – such as prednisolone
inhalers – such as beclometasone and fluticasone
nasal sprays – such as beclometasone and fluticasone
injections (given into joints, muscles or blood vessels) – such as methylprednisolone
creams, lotions and gels – such as hydrocortisone skin cream
Most steroids are only available on prescription, but a few (such as some creams or nasal sprays) can be bought from pharmacies and shops.
Side effects of steroids
Steroids do not tend to cause significant side effects if they're taken for a short time or at a low dose.
But sometimes they can cause unpleasant side effects, such as an increased appetite, mood changes and difficulty sleeping. This is most common with steroid tablets.
The side effects will usually pass once you finish the treatment, but do not stop taking your medicine without speaking to your doctor. Stopping a prescribed course of medicine can cause further unpleasant side effects (withdrawal symptoms).
Read more about:
side effects of steroid tablets

You can report any suspected side effect to the Yellow Card Scheme.
Uses for steroids
Steroids can be used to treat a wide range of conditions, including:
asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
hay fever
hives and eczema
painful joints or muscles – such as arthritis, tennis elbow and frozen shoulder
pain caused by an irritated or trapped nerve – such as sciatica
inflammatory bowel disease – such as Crohn's disease
lupus
multiple sclerosis (MS)
How steroids work
Steroids are a man-made version of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands which are 2 small glands found above the kidneys.
When taken in doses higher than the amount your body normally produces, steroids reduce redness and swelling (inflammation). This can help with inflammatory conditions such as asthma and eczema.
Steroids also reduce the activity of the immune system, which is the body's natural defence against illness and infection.
This can help treat autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body."
24,"Patient: Hi, I'm concerned about some symptoms I've been having and I came across Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Can you tell me more about it?

AI-Assistant: Of course! Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare and fatal condition that affects the brain. It causes rapid brain damage. What are the symptoms you have been experiencing?

Patient: I've been experiencing slurred speech and loss of balance. Could those be symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?

AI-Assistant: Yes, those are possible symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Other symptoms include loss of intellect and memory, changes in personality, vision problems, abnormal jerking movements, and progressive loss of brain function and mobility. However, it's important to keep in mind that these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions, so it's best to speak to a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis.

Patient: What causes CJD?

AI-Assistant: CJD appears to be caused by an abnormal infectious protein called a prion. These prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells. While the abnormal prions are technically infectious, they're very different from viruses and bacteria. For example, prions aren't destroyed by the extremes of heat and radiation used to kill bacteria and viruses, and antibiotics or antiviral medicines have no effect on them.

Patient: Are there different types of CJD?

AI-Assistant: Yes, there are 4 main types of CJD. The most common is sporadic CJD, which occurs spontaneously and has an unclear cause. Variant CJD is likely caused by consuming meat from a cow with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or ""mad cow"" disease), and familial CJD is a very rare genetic condition. Iatrogenic CJD is where the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment.

Patient: Is there a cure for CJD?

AI-Assistant: Unfortunately, there's currently no cure for CJD. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and make the affected person feel as comfortable as possible. This can include using medicine such as antidepressants to help with anxiety and depression, and painkillers to relieve pain. Some people will need nursing care and assistance with feeding. It's also worth noting that there is a compensation scheme for UK victims of variant CJD.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,1,f4df95ec69,44c0347251cbb53d8633032eef7d6dcfaad514120f64aea34a8793cd1d1bc4f9,"Overview
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and fatal condition that affects the brain. It causes brain damage that worsens rapidly over time.
Symptoms of CJD
Symptoms of CJD include:
loss of intellect and memory
changes in personality
loss of balance and co-ordination
slurred speech
vision problems and blindness
abnormal jerking movements
progressive loss of brain function and mobility
Most people with CJD will die within a year of the symptoms starting, usually from infection.
This is because the immobility caused by CJD can make people with the condition vulnerable to infection.

Types of CJD
There are 4 main types of CJD.
Sporadic CJD
Sporadic CJD is the most common type.
The precise cause of sporadic CJD is unclear, but it's been suggested that a normal brain protein changes abnormally (""misfolds"") and turns into a prion.
Most cases of sporadic CJD occur in adults aged between 45 and 75. On average, symptoms develop between the ages of 60 and 65.
Despite being the most common type of CJD, sporadic CJD is still very rare, affecting only 1 or 2 people in every million each year in the UK.
In 2020, there were 131 recorded deaths from sporadic CJD in the UK.
Variant CJD
Variant CJD (vCJD) is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or ""mad cow"" disease), a similar prion disease to CJD.
Since the link between variant CJD and BSE was discovered in 1996, strict controls have proved very effective in preventing meat from infected cattle entering the food chain.
See preventing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease for more information.
But the average time it takes for the symptoms of variant CJD to occur after initial infection (the incubation period) is still unclear.
The incubation period could be very long (more than 10 years) in some people, so those exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced can still develop variant CJD.
The prion that causes variant CJD can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, although this has only happened 5 times in the UK.
In 2020, there were no recorded deaths from variant CJD in the UK.
Familial or inherited CJD
Familial CJD is a very rare genetic condition where one of the genes a person inherits from their parent (the prion protein gene) carries a mutation that causes prions to form in their brain during adulthood, triggering the symptoms of CJD.
It affects about 1 in every 9 million people in the UK.
The symptoms of familial CJD usually first develop in people when they're in their early 50s.
In 2020, there were 6 deaths from familial CJD and similar inherited prion diseases in the UK.
Iatrogenic CJD
Iatrogenic CJD is where the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment.
For example, a common cause of iatrogenic CJD in the past was growth hormone treatment using human pituitary growth hormones extracted from deceased individuals, some of whom were infected with CJD.
Synthetic versions of human growth hormone have been used since 1985, so this is no longer a risk.
Iatrogenic CJD can also occur if instruments used during brain surgery on a person with CJD aren't properly cleaned between each surgical procedure and are reused on another person.
But increased awareness of these risks means iatrogenic CJD is now very rare.
In 2020, there was 1 death from iatrogenic CJD in the UK caused by receiving human growth hormone before 1985.
How CJD is treated
There's currently no cure for CJD, so treatment aims to relieve symptoms and make the affected person feel as comfortable as possible.
This can include using medicine such as antidepressants to help with anxiety and depression, and painkillers to relieve pain.
Some people will need nursing care and assistance with feeding.

Variant CJD compensation scheme
In October 2001, the government announced a compensation scheme for UK victims of variant CJD.
The vCJD Trust assesses claims and pays compensation to victims and their families."
25,"Patient: Hi,

AI-Assistant: Hello, how can I assist you?

Patient: I have been experiencing itchy, cracked and sore skin all over my body. What could be the reason for this?

AI-Assistant: Based on your description, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of atopic eczema, which is a type of skin condition. Would you like me to provide more information on this?

Patient: Yes, please. What are the symptoms of atopic eczema?

AI-Assistant: Atopic eczema can cause the skin to become itchy, dry, cracked and sore. Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread inflamed skin all over the body. Inflamed skin can become red on lighter skin, and darker brown, purple or gray on darker skin. This can also be more difficult to see on darker skin. Although atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, it most often affects the hands, insides of the elbows, backs of the knees and the face and scalp in children.

Patient: When should I seek medical advice?

AI-Assistant: It's important to see a GP if you have symptoms of atopic eczema. They'll usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions, such as when the symptoms first began, whether it comes and goes over time, and whether there's a history of atopic eczema in your family. Typically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and 3 or more of the following: visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin, a history of skin irritation, generally dry skin in the last 12 months, a history of asthma or hay fever, and the condition started before the age of 2.

Patient: Can atopic eczema be cured?

AI-Assistant: Atopic eczema currently has no cure. However, treatment can help to relieve the symptoms and many cases can improve over time. There are many different treatments that can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including self-care techniques such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers, emollients (moisturizing treatments) used on a daily basis for dry skin, and topical corticosteroids used to reduce swelling, redness, and itching during flare-ups.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,1,f4df95ec69,d6976ad9be9cef0ba9035df5727ad3bc1cf9e4123d03de1547b7209a012fb759,"Overview
Atopic eczema
Atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most common form of eczema, a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, dry and cracked.
Atopic eczema is more common in children, often developing before their first birthday. But it may also develop for the first time in adults.
It's usually a long-term (chronic) condition, although it can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older.
Symptoms of atopic eczema
Atopic eczema causes the skin to become itchy, dry, cracked and sore.
Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread inflamed skin all over the body.
Inflamed skin can become red on lighter skin, and darker brown, purple or grey on darker skin. This can also be more difficult to see on darker skin.
Although atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, it most often affects the hands, insides of the elbows, backs of the knees and the face and scalp in children.
People with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups).
When to seek medical advice
See a GP if you have symptoms of atopic eczema. They'll usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions, such as:
whether the rash is itchy and where it appears
when the symptoms first began
whether it comes and goes over time
whether there's a history of atopic eczema in your family
whether you have any other conditions, such as allergies or asthma
whether something in your diet or lifestyle may be contributing to your symptoms
Typically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and 3 or more of the following:
visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin – such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional
a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above
generally dry skin in the last 12 months
a history of asthma or hay fever – children under 4 must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has 1 of these conditions
the condition started before the age of 2 (this does not apply to children under the age of 4)
Causes of atopic eczema
The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it's clear it is not down to one single thing.
Atopic eczema often occurs in people who get allergies. ""Atopic"" means sensitivity to allergens.
It can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever.
The symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather.
Sometimes food allergies can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema.
You may be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse.
Allergy tests are not usually needed, although they're sometimes helpful in identifying whether a food allergy may be triggering symptoms.
Treating atopic eczema
Treatment for atopic eczema can help to relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time.
But there's currently no cure and severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life, which may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally.
There's also an increased risk of skin infections.
Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including:
self-care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers
emollients (moisturising treatments) – used on a daily basis for dry skin
topical corticosteroids – used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups
Other types of eczema
Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin.
Other types of eczema include:
discoid eczema – a type of eczema that occurs in circular or oval patches on the skin
contact dermatitis – a type of eczema that occurs when the body comes into contact with a particular substance
varicose eczema – a type of eczema that most often affects the lower legs and is caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins
seborrhoeic eczema – a type of eczema where red, scaly patches develop on the sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears and scalp
dyshidrotic eczema (pompholyx) – a type of eczema that causes tiny blisters to erupt across the palms of the hands"
26,"Patient: Hi, I'm a bit worried about HIV and AIDS. Can you tell me more about it?

AI-Assistant: Hello! Yes, of course. HIV is a virus that damages the cells in the immune system and weakens the ability to fight infections and diseases, whereas AIDS is a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when the immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus. Do you have any specific concerns or questions?

Patient: How does someone get HIV?

AI-Assistant: HIV is mainly spread through sexual contact, especially through anal or vaginal sex without a condom. Other ways of getting HIV include sharing needles and syringes or other injecting equipment, and transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. The chance of getting HIV through oral sex is very low, and it will depend on several factors.

Patient: Can people with HIV still live a long and healthy life?

AI-Assistant: Yes! With an early diagnosis, effective treatments, and regular medical care, most people with HIV can live a long and healthy life. There is currently no cure for HIV, but there are very effective drug treatments that can help manage the virus and enable most people with the virus to live a near-normal lifespan.

Patient: What are the symptoms of HIV infection?

AI-Assistant: Most people experience a short flu-like illness two to six weeks after HIV infection, which lasts for a week or two. After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years, although the virus continues to damage the immune system. This means many people with HIV do not know they're infected. Anyone who thinks they could have HIV should get tested.

Patient: How can HIV be diagnosed?

AI-Assistant: The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. You can get tested at your GP surgery, sexual health clinics, and clinics run by charities. You can also buy home testing or home sampling kits online or from pharmacies. It's important to get tested as soon as possible, especially if you think you might have been exposed to HIV.

Patient: Is there a cure for HIV?

AI-Assistant: Currently, there is no cure for HIV, but antiretroviral medicines can be used to treat and manage the virus. These medicines work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. There are very effective drug treatments that can help manage the virus and enable most people with the virus to live a near-normal lifespan.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,1,f4df95ec69,3eb4e29fa57e80a81ae35d0c8f92d00793983fd13452450a56657e82886d2184,"Overview
HIV and AIDS
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system and weakens your ability to fight everyday infections and disease.
AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus.
While AIDS cannot be transmitted from 1 person to another, the HIV virus can.
There's currently no cure for HIV, but there are very effective drug treatments that enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life.
With an early diagnosis and effective treatments, most people with HIV will not develop any AIDS-related illnesses and will live a near-normal lifespan.
Symptoms of HIV infection
Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after HIV infection, which lasts for a week or 2.
After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years, although the virus continues to damage your immune system.
This means many people with HIV do not know they're infected.
Anyone who thinks they could have HIV should get tested.
Some people are advised to have regular tests as they're at particularly high risk.
Read more about who's most at risk of HIV
Causes of HIV infection
HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person. This includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood and breast milk.
It's a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long.
HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat, urine or saliva.
The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through having anal or vaginal sex without a condom.
Other ways of getting HIV include:
sharing needles, syringes or other injecting equipment
transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding
The chance of getting HIV through oral sex is very low and will be dependent on many things, such as whether you receive or give oral sex and the oral hygiene of the person giving the oral sex.
Diagnosing HIV
Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV.
You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities.
Find HIV testing services near you
The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection.
It's important to be aware that:
emergency anti-HIV medicine called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may stop you becoming infected if started within 72 hours of possible exposure to the virus – it's recommended that you start it as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours
an early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the virus, reduce the risk of becoming more unwell and reduce the chance of passing the virus on to others
Both positive and negative HIV tests may need to be repeated 1 to 3 months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the window period), but you should not wait this long to seek help:
clinics may offer a finger prick blood test, which can give you a result in minutes, but it may take up to a few days to get the results of a more detailed HIV test
home testing or home sampling kits are available to buy online or from pharmacies – depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few days
If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result.
If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options.
Treatment for HIV
Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage.
These come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day.
HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV medicine very easily, but taking a combination of different medicines makes this much less likely.
Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines. It's vital these are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.
The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load. This means the level of HIV virus in your body is low enough to not be detected by a test.
Living with HIV
If you're living with HIV, taking effective HIV treatment and being undetectable significantly reduces your risk of passing HIV on to others.
You'll also be encouraged to:
take regular exercise
eat a healthy diet
stop smoking
have yearly flu jabs to minimise the risk of getting serious illnesses
Without treatment, the immune system will become severely damaged, and life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and severe infections can occur.
If you're planning on getting pregnant, it's important to talk to a GP. Although rare, it's possible to transmit HIV to your baby.
Preventing HIV
Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV infection.
There are many effective ways to prevent or reduce the risk of HIV infection, including:
using a condom for sex
post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
treatment for HIV to reduce the viral load to undetectable
if you use drugs, never sharing needles or other injecting equipment, including syringes, spoons and swabs
Speak to your local sexual health clinic or a GP for further advice about the best way to reduce your risk.
For people with HIV, if you have been taking effective HIV treatment and your viral load has been undetectable for 6 months or more, it means you cannot pass the virus on through sex.
This is called undetectable=untransmittable (U=U).

1;What are the symptoms of a heart attack?;Symptoms of a heart attack include chest pain, pain in other parts of the body such as arms, jaw, neck, back, and tummy, feeling lightheaded or dizzy, sweating, shortness of breath, feeling sick or being sick, an overwhelming feeling of anxiety, coughing or wheezing. The chest pain is often severe, but some people may only experience minor pain, similar to indigestion. While the most common symptom in both men and women is chest pain, women are more likely to have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, feeling or being sick, and back or jaw pain.
2;What should one do in case someone is having a heart attack?;If you think someone might be having a heart attack, call 999 immediately. The faster you act, the better their chances. While waiting for an ambulance, it may help to chew and then swallow a tablet of aspirin (ideally 300mg), as long as the person having a heart attack is not allergic to aspirin. Aspirin helps to thin the blood and improve blood flow to the heart.
3;What is coronary heart disease and how can it cause a heart attack?;Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart attacks. CHD is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart get clogged with deposits of cholesterol, known as plaques. Before a heart attack, one of the plaques bursts (ruptures), causing a blood clot to develop at the site of the rupture. The clot may block the supply of blood to the heart, triggering a heart attack.
4;What are the main treatments for a heart attack?;In hospital, treatment for a heart attack depends on how serious it is. The 2 main treatments are using medicines to dissolve blood clots and surgery to help restore blood to the heart. While waiting for treatment, it may help to chew and then swallow a tablet of aspirin (ideally 300mg), as long as the person having a heart attack is not allergic to aspirin. Aspirin helps to thin the blood and improve blood flow to the heart.
5;What steps can one take to reduce the risk of having a heart attack?;There are 5 main steps you can take to reduce your risk of having a heart attack (or having another heart attack): smokers should quit smoking, lose weight if you're overweight or obese, do regular exercise – adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week, unless advised otherwise by the doctor in charge of your care, eat a low-fat, high-fibre diet, including wholegrains and at least 5 portions of fruit, and vegetables a day, moderate your alcohol consumption.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,1,f53cf99826,e7d60e61f257a2f14257db3d4cb6f0226abbac104dbb85a55148efe8d46df4d6,"Overview
Heart attack
A heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI) is a serious medical emergency in which the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked, usually by a blood clot.
A heart attack is a medical emergency. Call 999 and ask for an ambulance if you suspect a heart attack.
A lack of blood to the heart may seriously damage the heart muscle and can be life threatening.
Symptoms of a heart attack
Symptoms of a heart attack can include:
chest pain – a feeling of pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across your chest
pain in other parts of the body – it can feel as if the pain is spreading from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and tummy
feeling lightheaded or dizzy
sweating
shortness of breath
feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)
an overwhelming feeling of anxiety (similar to a panic attack)
coughing or wheezing
The chest pain is often severe, but some people may only experience minor pain, similar to indigestion.
While the most common symptom in both men and women is chest pain, women are more likely to have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, feeling or being sick and back or jaw pain.

Causes of a heart attack
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart attacks.
CHD is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart get clogged with deposits of cholesterol, known as plaques.
Before a heart attack, 1 of the plaques bursts (ruptures), causing a blood clot to develop at the site of the rupture.
The clot may block the supply of blood to the heart, triggering a heart attack.
Recovering from a heart attack
The time it takes to recover from a heart attack will depend on the amount of damage to your heart muscle.
Most people can return to work after having a heart attack. Some people are well enough to return to work after 2 weeks. Other people may take several months to recover. How quickly you can go back to work depends on your health, the state of your heart and the type of work you do.
The recovery process aims to:
reduce your risk of another heart attack through a combination of lifestyle changes (such as eating a healthy diet), and medicines (such as statins), which help to lower blood cholesterol levels
gradually restore your physical fitness so you can resume normal activities (cardiac rehabilitation)
Find out more about recovering from a heart attack
Complications of a heart attack
Complications of a heart attack can be serious and possibly life threatening.
These include:
arrhythmias – these are abnormal heartbeats. 1 type is where the heart begins beating faster and faster, then stops beating (cardiac arrest)
cardiogenic shock – where the heart's muscles are severely damaged and can no longer contract properly to supply enough blood to maintain many body functions
heart rupture – where the heart's muscles, walls or valves split apart (rupture)
These complications can happen quickly after a heart attack and are a leading cause of death.
Many people die suddenly from a complication of a heart attack before reaching hospital or within the 1st month after a heart attack.
The outlook often depends on:
age – serious complications are more likely as you get older
the severity of the heart attack – how much of the heart's muscle has been damaged during the attack
how long it took before a person received treatment – treatment for a heart attack should begin as soon as possible

Laryngitis is when your voice box or vocal cords in the throat become irritated or swollen. It usually goes away by itself within 1 to 2 weeks.
Check if you have laryngitis
Laryngitis usually comes on suddenly and gets worse during the first 3 days.
The main symptoms are:
a hoarse (croaky) voice
sometimes losing your voice
an irritating cough that does not go away
always needing to clear your throat
a sore throat
Children can also:
have a temperature of 38C or above
be off their food or drink
have difficulty breathing (but this is rare)
Laryngitis is often linked to other illnesses, such as colds and flu, so you may also have other symptoms.
If you're not sure it's laryngitis, check other sore throat symptoms.
How you can treat laryngitis yourself
Laryngitis usually goes away on its own after 1 to 2 weeks and you do not need to see a GP.
Do
try to speak as little as possible
drink plenty of fluids
keep the air moist by putting out bowls of water – central heating and air conditioning make the air dry
gargle with warm salty water (children should not try this)
Don’t
do not talk loudly or whisper – both strain your voice
do not smoke
do not spend time in smoky or dusty places
do not drink too much caffeine or alcohol – they cause dehydration
How to gargle with salty water
Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water. Warm water helps salt dissolve.
Gargle with the solution then spit it out. Do not swallow it.
Repeat as often as you like.
This is not suitable for younger children.
A pharmacist can help with laryngitis
Speak to a pharmacist about your sore throat.
They can give advice and suggest treatments, including:
paracetamol or ibuprofen
cough syrup to help with your cough
solutions to gargle or lozenges for the pain

Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
your symptoms do not improve after 2 weeks
it's very painful or it's difficult to swallow
you keep getting laryngitis or voice problems
What happens at your appointment
The GP will try to work out what has caused your laryngitis.
They may:
look inside your throat using a small mirror
wipe a cotton bud around the back of your throat for testing
arrange a blood test
refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist (if you keep getting laryngitis)
If your laryngitis is caused by an infection, the GP might prescribe antibiotics.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if:
you or your child are having difficulty breathing
Find your nearest A&E
What causes laryngitis
Laryngitis usually happens when you have an infection from a virus, such as cold or flu. A flu vaccination will help prevent you getting flu.
Other things that cause laryngitis include:
allergies to things like dust and fumes
acid from your stomach coming up your throat (acid reflux)
coughing over a long time
clearing your throat all the time"

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that can affect the brain and spinal cord, causing a wide range of potential symptoms, including problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance.
It's a lifelong condition that can sometimes cause serious disability, although it can occasionally be mild.
In many cases, it's possible to treat symptoms. Average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with MS.
It's most commonly diagnosed in people in their 20s, 30s and 40s although it can develop at any age. It's about 2 to 3 times more common in women than men.
MS is one of the most common causes of disability in younger adults.
Symptoms of multiple sclerosis
The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person and can affect any part of the body.
The main symptoms include:
fatigue
difficulty walking
vision problems, such as blurred vision
problems controlling the bladder
numbness or tingling in different parts of the body
muscle stiffness and spasms
problems with balance and co-ordination
problems with thinking, learning and planning
Depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms may come and go in phases or get steadily worse over time (progress).
Getting medical advice
See a GP if you're worried you might have signs of MS.
The symptoms often have many other causes, so they're not necessarily a sign of MS.
Let the GP know about the specific pattern of symptoms you're experiencing.
If they think you could have MS, you'll be referred to a specialist in conditions of the nervous system (a neurologist), who may suggest tests such as an MRI scan to check for features of MS.

Types of multiple sclerosis
MS starts in 1 of 2 general ways: with individual relapses (attacks or exacerbations) or with gradual progression.
Relapsing remitting MS
Between 8 and 9 of every 10 people with MS are diagnosed with the relapsing remitting type.
Someone with relapsing remitting MS will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, known as relapses.
These typically worsen over a few days, last for days to weeks to months, then slowly improve over a similar time period.
Relapses often occur without warning, but are sometimes associated with a period of illness or stress.
The symptoms of a relapse may disappear altogether, with or without treatment, although some symptoms often persist, with repeated attacks happening over several years.
Periods between attacks are known as periods of remission. These can last for years at a time.
After many years (usually decades), many, but not all, people with relapsing remitting MS go on to develop secondary progressive MS.
In this type of MS, symptoms gradually worsen over time without obvious attacks. Some people continue to have infrequent relapses during this stage.
About two-thirds of people with relapsing remitting MS will develop secondary progressive MS.
Primary progressive MS
Between 1 and 2 in every 10 people with the condition start their MS with a gradual worsening of symptoms.
In primary progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and accumulate over several years, and there are no periods of remission, though people often have periods where their condition appears to stabilise.
What causes multiple sclerosis?
MS is an autoimmune condition. This is when something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks a healthy part of the body – in this case, the brain or spinal cord of the nervous system.
In MS, the immune system attacks the layer that surrounds and protects the nerves called the myelin sheath.
This damages and scars the sheath, and potentially the underlying nerves, meaning that messages travelling along the nerves become slowed or disrupted.
Exactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is unclear, but most experts think a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved.
Treatments for multiple sclerosis
There's currently no cure for MS, but a number of treatments can help control the condition and ease symptoms.
The treatment you need will depend on the specific symptoms and difficulties you have.
It may include:
treating relapses with short courses of steroid medicine to speed up recovery
specific treatments for individual MS symptoms
treatment to reduce the number of relapses using medicines called disease-modifying therapies
Disease-modifying therapies may also help to slow or reduce the overall worsening of disability in people with a type of MS called relapsing remitting MS, and in some people with types called primary and secondary progressive MS, who have relapses.
Unfortunately, there's currently no treatment that can slow the progress of primary progressive MS, or secondary progressive MS, where there are no relapses.
Many therapies aiming to treat progressive MS are currently being researched.
Living with multiple sclerosis
If you have been diagnosed with MS, it's important to take care of your general health.

Outlook
MS can be a challenging condition to live with, but new treatments over the past 20 years have considerably improved the quality of life of people with the condition.
MS itself is rarely fatal, but complications may arise from severe MS, such as chest or bladder infections, or swallowing difficulties.
The average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average, and this gap appears to be getting smaller all the time.
Charities and support groups for multiple sclerosis
There are 2 main MS charities in the UK:
MS Society
MS Trust
These organisations offer useful advice, publications, news items about ongoing research, blogs and chatrooms.
They can be very useful if you, or someone you know, has just been diagnosed with MS.
There's also the shift.ms website, an online community for younger people affected by MS.

30,"Patient: Hi, I have been feeling a bit concerned about my health lately. Can you help me out?

AI-Assistant: Bonjour, je suis disponible pour vous aider. What seems to be bothering you?

Patient: Lately, I have been experiencing a lot of headaches and dizziness. Could it be possible that it is related to high blood pressure?

AI-Assistant: It's possible. High blood pressure, or hypertension, can have many symptoms, including headaches and dizziness. The only way to know for sure is to have your blood pressure checked. Have you had your blood pressure checked recently?

Patient: No, I haven't. When should I get it checked?

AI-Assistant: It's recommended that all adults over 40 have their blood pressure checked at least every 5 years. However, if you are experiencing symptoms like headaches and dizziness, you should make an appointment with your doctor to have it checked as soon as possible.

Patient: Okay. What is considered high blood pressure?

AI-Assistant: Blood pressure is recorded with two numbers: systolic pressure (the higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body, and diastolic pressure (the lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels. High blood pressure is considered to be from 140/90mmHg. However, everyone's blood pressure will be slightly different, and what's considered high for you may be normal for someone else.

Patient: What are the risks of high blood pressure?

AI-Assistant: High blood pressure puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes. Persistent high blood pressure can increase your risk of a number of serious and potentially life-threatening health conditions. These include heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease, and vascular dementia.

Patient: That sounds scary. What can I do to reduce my risk of high blood pressure?

AI-Assistant: Making healthy lifestyle changes can sometimes help reduce your chances of getting high blood pressure and help lower your blood pressure if it's already high. These lifestyle changes include reducing the amount of salt you eat, cutting back on alcohol, losing weight if you're overweight, exercising regularly, cutting down on caffeine, and quitting smoking.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,French,1,f4df95ec69,e9920e5f8985ded0d8a9fc24de63f81c50fffcc97ff274eac0ddb2142330d3a5,"Overview
High blood pressure (hypertension)
High blood pressure, or hypertension, rarely has noticeable symptoms. But if untreated, it increases your risk of serious problems such as heart attacks and strokes.
Around a third of adults in the UK have high blood pressure, although many will not realise it.
The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have your blood pressure checked.
What is high blood pressure?
Blood pressure is recorded with 2 numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body.
The diastolic pressure (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels.
They're both measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg).
As a general guide:
high blood pressure is considered to be from 140/90mmHg (or an average of 135/85mmHg at home) – or 150/90mmHg (or an average of 145/85mmHg at home) if you're over the age of 80
ideal blood pressure is usually considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg, while the target for over-80s is below 150/90mmHg (or 145/85mmHg at home)
Blood pressure readings between 120/80mmHg and 140/90mmHg could mean you're at risk of developing high blood pressure if you do not take steps to keep your blood pressure under control.
Everyone's blood pressure will be slightly different. What's considered low or high for you may be normal for someone else.
Risks of high blood pressure
If your blood pressure is too high, it puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes.
Persistent high blood pressure can increase your risk of a number of serious and potentially life-threatening health conditions, such as:
heart disease
heart attacks
strokes
heart failure
peripheral arterial disease
aortic aneurysms
kidney disease
vascular dementia
If you have high blood pressure, reducing it even a small amount can help lower your risk of these health conditions.
Check your blood pressure
The only way of knowing whether you have high blood pressure is to have a blood pressure test.
All adults over 40 are advised to have their blood pressure checked at least every 5 years.
Getting this done is easy and could save your life.
You can get your blood pressure tested at a number of places, including:
at your GP surgery
at some pharmacies
as part of your NHS Health Check
in some workplaces
You can also check your blood pressure yourself with a home blood pressure monitor.
Find out more about getting a blood pressure test
Things that can increase your risk of getting high blood pressure
It's not always clear what causes high blood pressure, but there are things that can increase your risk.
You might be more at risk if you:
are overweight
eat too much salt and do not eat enough fruit and vegetables
do not do enough exercise
drink too much alcohol or coffee (or other caffeine-based drinks)
smoke
do not get much sleep or have disturbed sleep
are over 65
have a relative with high blood pressure
are of black African or black Caribbean descent
live in a deprived area
Making healthy lifestyle changes can sometimes help reduce your chances of getting high blood pressure and help lower your blood pressure if it's already high.
Treatment for high blood pressure
Doctors can help you keep your blood pressure to a safe level using:
lifestyle changes
medicines
What works best is different for each person.
Talk to your doctor to help you decide about treatment.
This patient decision aid (PDF, 132kb) can also help you to understand your treatment options.
Lifestyle changes to reduce blood pressure
These lifestyle changes can help prevent and lower high blood pressure:
reduce the amount of salt you eat and have a generally healthy diet
cut back on alcohol
lose weight if you're overweight
exercise regularly
cut down on caffeine
stop smoking
Some people with high blood pressure may also need to take 1 or more medicines to stop their blood pressure getting too high.
Medicines for high blood pressure
If you're diagnosed with high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend taking 1 or more medicines to keep it under control.
These come as tablets and usually need to be taken once a day.
Common blood pressure medicines include:
ACE inhibitors – such as enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril
angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) – such as candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, valsartan and olmesartan
calcium channel blockers – such as amlodipine, felodipine and nifedipine or diltiazem and verapamil
diuretics – such as indapamide and bendroflumethiazide
beta blockers – such as atenolol and bisoprolol
alpha blockers – such as doxazosin
other diuretics – such as amiloride and spironolactone
The medicine recommended for you will depend on things like how high your blood pressure is, your age and your ethnicity."

1;Qu'est-ce que la bronchiolite?;La bronchiolite est une infection fréquente des voies respiratoires qui affecte les bébés et les enfants de moins de 2 ans. Elle est causée par une infection virale, le plus souvent le virus respiratoire syncytial (VRS). Elle peut causer des symptômes tels que de la toux, un nez qui coule ou bouché, de la fièvre et des difficultés respiratoires. La plupart des cas sont bénins et peuvent être traités à domicile, mais elle peut être grave chez certains enfants.
2;Quels en sont les symptômes?;Les premiers symptômes de la bronchiolite sont similaires à ceux d'un rhume, tels que des éternuements, un nez qui coule ou bouché, de la toux et une légère fièvre de 38 °C. Les enfants atteints de bronchiolite peuvent ensuite présenter d'autres symptômes tels que des difficultés respiratoires, des troubles de l'alimentation, une respiration bruyante (sifflements) et de l'irritabilité. Les symptômes sont généralement les plus graves entre les jours 3 et 5 et la toux disparaît habituellement en 3 semaines.
3;Quels sont les traitements de la bronchiolite?;Il n'y a pas de traitement spécifique pour la bronchiolite, car la plupart du temps, elle guérit seule. Cependant, chez certains enfants, elle peut être plus grave et nécessiter une hospitalisation. Vous pouvez soulager les symptômes de votre enfant en lui donnant du paracétamol ou de l'ibuprofène (seulement après consultation d'un médecin), en utilisant des gouttes de solution saline pour déboucher les sinus, en maintenant votre enfant en position verticale autant que possible et en l'encourageant à boire beaucoup de liquides.
4;Quand faut-il appeler les urgences pour un enfant atteint de bronchiolite?;Vous devez appeler le 999 ou vous rendre aux urgences si votre enfant a des difficultés à respirer, s'il y a des pauses lorsqu’il respire, si sa peau, sa langue ou ses lèvres sont bleues, s'il est mou et ne se réveille pas ou reste endormi. Il est important de faire confiance à votre propre jugement en tant que parent si vous avez l'impression que votre enfant est gravement malade.
5;Comment prévenir la bronchiolite chez les jeunes enfants?;Il existe certaines choses que vous pouvez faire pour réduire les risques que votre enfant contracte une bronchiolite ou propage les virus qui la causent, comme se laver les mains régulièrement, nettoyer les jouets et les surfaces fréquemment, utiliser des mouchoirs jetables et les jeter immédiatement après utilisation, garder les nouveau-nés à l'écart de toute personne atteinte d'un rhume ou de la grippe, surtout s'ils ont moins de 2 mois ou s'ils sont prématurés. Il est également important de ne pas fumer autour de votre enfant car les enfants qui respirent la fumée de cigarette ont un risque plus élevé de développer une bronchiolite.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,French,1,f53cf99826,ad8ac03102780f31b517795eb5b105aae0e65b610638848499e5726e32869703,"Bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is a common chest infection that affects babies and children under 2. It's usually mild and can be treated at home, but it can be serious.
Bronchiolitis is different from bronchitis, which causes a cough with lots of mucus and can affect people of all ages.
Check if it's bronchiolitis
The early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to a cold, such as sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, a cough and a slightly high temperature of 38C.
A child with bronchiolitis may then get other symptoms, such as:
breathing more quickly
finding it difficult to feed or eat
noisy breathing (wheezing)
becoming irritable
Symptoms are usually worst between days 3 and 5, and the cough usually gets better in 3 weeks.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if:
your child is having difficulty breathing – you may notice grunting noises or their tummy sucking under their ribs
there are pauses when your child breathes
your child's skin, tongue or lips are blue
your child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake
As a parent, you may know if your child seems seriously unwell and should trust your own judgement.
Find your nearest A&E
Urgent advice:
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if:
your child has had a cold and it's getting worse
your child is feeding or eating much less than normal
your child has had a dry nappy for 12 hours or more, or shows other signs of dehydration
your baby is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38C, or is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39C or higher
your baby feels hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, or feels sweaty
your child is very tired or irritable
Treatments for bronchiolitis
There's no specific treatment for bronchiolitis. It usually gets better on its own and you can look after your child at home.
But it can be serious in some children, who may need to be treated in hospital.
Do
give children's paracetamol to babies and children over 2 months old or ibuprofen to babies and children over 3 months old – but do not give aspirin to a child under 16
try using salt water (saline) drops if your child's nose is blocked
keep your child upright as much as possible when they're awake – this will help them breathe more easily
encourage your child to drink lots of fluids – try smaller feeds more often in babies, and give older children extra water or diluted fruit juice
Don’t
do not smoke around your child
do not try to lower your child's temperature by sponging them with cool water or taking off all their clothes
Preventing bronchiolitis
There are some things you can do to lower the chances of your child getting bronchiolitis or spreading the viruses that cause it, such as:
wash your hands and your child's hands often
wash or wipe down toys and clean surfaces regularly
use disposable tissues and throw them away as soon as you've used them
keep newborn babies away from anyone with a cold or the flu – especially if they're under 2 months old or were premature
It's also important not to smoke around your child. Children who breathe in cigarette smoke have a higher risk of getting bronchiolitis.
Children at risk of severe bronchiolitis
Some children may have a higher risk of getting seriously ill with bronchiolitis.
This includes children who:
were born very prematurely
have a heart or lung condition
have a weakened immune system
These children may be able to have treatment in the winter (between October and March) to stop them getting severe bronchiolitis.
Causes of bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is caused by a viral infection, usually the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
RSV is very common and spreads easily in coughs and sneezes. Almost all children have had it by the time they're 2.
In older children and adults, RSV may cause a cough or cold, but in young children it can cause bronchiolitis."

1;Quels types de stéroïdes existent?;Il existe plusieurs types de stéroïdes tels que les comprimés, les sirops et les liquides, les inhalateurs, les sprays nasaux, les injections, les crèmes, les lotions et les gels. Les stéroïdes ne sont généralement disponibles que sur ordonnance, à l'exception de certains produits en vente libre comme certaines crèmes ou sprays nasaux.
2;Quels sont les effets secondaires des stéroïdes?;Les stéroïdes ne provoquent pas d'effets secondaires significatifs s'ils sont pris pendant une courte période ou à faible dose. Cependant, dans certains cas, ils peuvent provoquer des effets secondaires désagréables tels qu'une augmentation de l'appétit, des changements d'humeur et des difficultés à dormir, surtout avec les comprimés. Les effets secondaires disparaissent généralement une fois le traitement terminé. Cependant, il est important de ne pas arrêter votre traitement sans en parler d'abord à votre médecin, car l'arrêt d'un traitement prescrit peut entraîner d'autres effets secondaires désagréables (symptômes de sevrage).
3;Comment fonctionnent les stéroïdes?;Les stéroïdes sont une version synthétique des hormones produites normalement par les glandes surrénales trouvées au-dessus des reins. Lorsqu'ils sont pris à des doses supérieures à celles normalement produites par votre corps, les stéroïdes réduisent les rougeurs et les gonflements (inflammation). Cela peut aider à traiter des affections inflammatoires telles que l'asthme et l'eczéma. Les stéroïdes réduisent également l'activité du système immunitaire, qui est la défense naturelle du corps contre les maladies et les infections, et peuvent aider à traiter des affections auto-immunes telles que l'arthrite rhumatoïde ou le lupus, qui sont causées par une attaque erronée du système immunitaire contre le corps.
4;Pour quels types de conditions les stéroïdes sont-ils utilisés?;Les stéroïdes peuvent être utilisés pour traiter une large gamme de conditions médicales, notamment l'asthme et la maladie pulmonaire obstructive chronique (MPOC), le rhume des foins, l'urticaire et l'eczéma, les douleurs articulaires ou musculaires (comme l'arthrite, le tennis elbow et l'épaule congelée), la douleur causée par un nerf irrité ou piégé (comme la sciatique), les troubles inflammatoires de l'intestin (comme la maladie de Crohn), le lupus, la sclérose en plaques (SEP).
5;Les stéroïdes prescrits sont-ils illégaux?;La plupart des stéroïdes ne sont disponibles que sur ordonnance, mais quelques-uns (comme certaines crèmes ou certains sprays nasaux) peuvent être achetés en pharmacie ou en magasin. Les stéroïdes prescrits, lorsqu'ils sont pris selon l'ordonnance, ne sont pas illégaux. Les stéroïdes illégaux, également appelés stéroïdes anabolisants, sont souvent utilisés illicitement par certaines personnes pour augmenter leur masse musculaire. Il est important de ne prendre des stéroïdes que sur les conseils d'un professionnel de la santé et de ne pas s'engager dans l'utilisation illicite de stéroïdes anabolisants, car cela peut entraîner de graves problèmes de santé.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,French,1,f53cf99826,12b736a59038b4ae3545f6a947ada7ec65e35b0fd380459e249cc4f74ec39b13,"Steroids
Steroids, also called corticosteroids, are anti-inflammatory medicines used to treat a range of conditions.
They're different from anabolic steroids, which are often used illegally by some people to increase their muscle mass.
Types of steroids
Steroids come in many different forms.
The main types are:
tablets, syrups and liquids – such as prednisolone
inhalers – such as beclometasone and fluticasone
nasal sprays – such as beclometasone and fluticasone
injections (given into joints, muscles or blood vessels) – such as methylprednisolone
creams, lotions and gels – such as hydrocortisone skin cream
Most steroids are only available on prescription, but a few (such as some creams or nasal sprays) can be bought from pharmacies and shops.
Side effects of steroids
Steroids do not tend to cause significant side effects if they're taken for a short time or at a low dose.
But sometimes they can cause unpleasant side effects, such as an increased appetite, mood changes and difficulty sleeping. This is most common with steroid tablets.
The side effects will usually pass once you finish the treatment, but do not stop taking your medicine without speaking to your doctor. Stopping a prescribed course of medicine can cause further unpleasant side effects (withdrawal symptoms).

You can report any suspected side effect to the Yellow Card Scheme.
Uses for steroids
Steroids can be used to treat a wide range of conditions, including:
asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
hay fever
hives and eczema
painful joints or muscles – such as arthritis, tennis elbow and frozen shoulder
pain caused by an irritated or trapped nerve – such as sciatica
inflammatory bowel disease – such as Crohn's disease
lupus
multiple sclerosis (MS)
How steroids work
Steroids are a man-made version of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands which are 2 small glands found above the kidneys.
When taken in doses higher than the amount your body normally produces, steroids reduce redness and swelling (inflammation). This can help with inflammatory conditions such as asthma and eczema.
Steroids also reduce the activity of the immune system, which is the body's natural defence against illness and infection.
This can help treat autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body."

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and fatal condition that affects the brain. It causes brain damage that worsens rapidly over time.
Symptoms of CJD
Symptoms of CJD include:
loss of intellect and memory
changes in personality
loss of balance and co-ordination
slurred speech
vision problems and blindness
abnormal jerking movements
progressive loss of brain function and mobility
Most people with CJD will die within a year of the symptoms starting, usually from infection.
This is because the immobility caused by CJD can make people with the condition vulnerable to infection.
Read more about the symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and diagnosing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
What causes CJD?
CJD appears to be caused by an abnormal infectious protein called a prion. These prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells.
While the abnormal prions are technically infectious, they're very different from viruses and bacteria.
For example, prions aren't destroyed by the extremes of heat and radiation used to kill bacteria and viruses, and antibiotics or antiviral medicines have no effect on them.
Read more about the causes of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Types of CJD
There are 4 main types of CJD.
Sporadic CJD
Sporadic CJD is the most common type.
The precise cause of sporadic CJD is unclear, but it's been suggested that a normal brain protein changes abnormally (""misfolds"") and turns into a prion.
Most cases of sporadic CJD occur in adults aged between 45 and 75. On average, symptoms develop between the ages of 60 and 65.
Despite being the most common type of CJD, sporadic CJD is still very rare, affecting only 1 or 2 people in every million each year in the UK.
In 2020, there were 131 recorded deaths from sporadic CJD in the UK.
Variant CJD
Variant CJD (vCJD) is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or ""mad cow"" disease), a similar prion disease to CJD.
Since the link between variant CJD and BSE was discovered in 1996, strict controls have proved very effective in preventing meat from infected cattle entering the food chain.
See preventing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease for more information.
But the average time it takes for the symptoms of variant CJD to occur after initial infection (the incubation period) is still unclear.
The incubation period could be very long (more than 10 years) in some people, so those exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced can still develop variant CJD.
The prion that causes variant CJD can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, although this has only happened 5 times in the UK.
In 2020, there were no recorded deaths from variant CJD in the UK.
Familial or inherited CJD
Familial CJD is a very rare genetic condition where one of the genes a person inherits from their parent (the prion protein gene) carries a mutation that causes prions to form in their brain during adulthood, triggering the symptoms of CJD.
It affects about 1 in every 9 million people in the UK.
The symptoms of familial CJD usually first develop in people when they're in their early 50s.
In 2020, there were 6 deaths from familial CJD and similar inherited prion diseases in the UK.
Iatrogenic CJD
Iatrogenic CJD is where the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment.
For example, a common cause of iatrogenic CJD in the past was growth hormone treatment using human pituitary growth hormones extracted from deceased individuals, some of whom were infected with CJD.
Synthetic versions of human growth hormone have been used since 1985, so this is no longer a risk.
Iatrogenic CJD can also occur if instruments used during brain surgery on a person with CJD aren't properly cleaned between each surgical procedure and are reused on another person.
But increased awareness of these risks means iatrogenic CJD is now very rare.
In 2020, there was 1 death from iatrogenic CJD in the UK caused by receiving human growth hormone before 1985.
How CJD is treated
There's currently no cure for CJD, so treatment aims to relieve symptoms and make the affected person feel as comfortable as possible.
This can include using medicine such as antidepressants to help with anxiety and depression, and painkillers to relieve pain.
Some people will need nursing care and assistance with feeding.
Read more about treating Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Variant CJD compensation scheme
In October 2001, the government announced a compensation scheme for UK victims of variant CJD.
The vCJD Trust assesses claims and pays compensation to victims and their families."

1;Quels sont les symptômes de l'eczéma atopique ?;L'eczéma atopique provoque des démangeaisons, une peau sèche, craquelée et douloureuse. Certaines personnes ont seulement de petites plaques de peau sèche, mais d'autres peuvent souffrir d'une inflammation généralisée de la peau sur tout le corps. La peau enflammée peut devenir rouge sur les peaux plus claires, et plus sombre marron, violet ou gris sur les peaux plus foncées. Bien que l'eczéma atopique puisse affecter n'importe quelle partie du corps, il affecte souvent les mains, l'intérieur des coudes, les arrière-genoux, le visage et le cuir chevelu chez les enfants.
2;Quel est le traitement pour l'eczéma atopique ?;Il n'y a pas de remède pour l'eczéma atopique, mais il y a plusieurs traitements pour contrôler les symptômes. Les techniques d'auto-traitement, telles que la réduction du grattage et l'évitement des déclencheurs, peuvent être efficaces. Les émollients (traitement hydratant) peuvent être utilisés quotidiennement pour la peau sèche. Les corticostéroïdes topiques, qui réduisent le gonflement, la rougeur et les démangeaisons pendant les poussées, peuvent également être utilisés. De nombreux autres traitements peuvent être utilisés pour soulager les symptômes et gérer l'eczéma, notamment la photothérapie, les immunosuppresseurs, les traitements immunomodulateurs topiques et les traitements antihistaminiques.
3;Quand devrais-je chercher des conseils médicaux pour l'eczéma atopique ?;Vous devriez consulter votre médecin généraliste si vous avez des symptômes d'eczéma atopique. Ils pourront généralement diagnostiquer l'eczéma atopique en regardant votre peau et en posant des questions sur les points suivants : si l'éruption est prurigineuse et où elle apparaît, quand les symptômes ont commencé, si cela va et vient au fil du temps, s'il y a des antécédents d'eczéma atopique dans votre famille, si vous avez d'autres affections, telles que des allergies ou de l'asthme, si quelque chose dans votre alimentation ou votre mode de vie peut contribuer à vos symptômes.
4;Y a-t-il d'autres types d'eczéma en plus de l'eczéma atopique ?;Oui, il existe d'autres types d'eczéma en plus de l'eczéma atopique. Discoid eczéma est un type d'eczéma qui se produit sous forme de taches circulaires ou ovales sur la peau. La dermatite de contact est un type d'eczéma qui se produit lorsque le corps entre en contact avec une substance particulière. L'eczéma variqueux est un type d'eczéma qui affecte le plus souvent les jambes inférieures et est causé par des problèmes de circulation sanguine dans les veines des jambes. L'eczéma séborrhéique est un type d'eczéma où des plaques rouges et squameuses se développent sur les côtés du nez, les sourcils, les oreilles et le cuir chevelu. L'eczéma dyshidrotique (pompholyx) est un type d'eczéma qui cause de petites vésicules à éclater sur les paumes des mains.

Atopic eczema
Atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most common form of eczema, a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, dry and cracked.
Atopic eczema is more common in children, often developing before their first birthday. But it may also develop for the first time in adults.
It's usually a long-term (chronic) condition, although it can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older.
Symptoms of atopic eczema
Atopic eczema causes the skin to become itchy, dry, cracked and sore.
Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread inflamed skin all over the body.
Inflamed skin can become red on lighter skin, and darker brown, purple or grey on darker skin. This can also be more difficult to see on darker skin.
Although atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, it most often affects the hands, insides of the elbows, backs of the knees and the face and scalp in children.
People with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups).
When to seek medical advice
See a GP if you have symptoms of atopic eczema. They'll usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions, such as:
whether the rash is itchy and where it appears
when the symptoms first began
whether it comes and goes over time
whether there's a history of atopic eczema in your family
whether you have any other conditions, such as allergies or asthma
whether something in your diet or lifestyle may be contributing to your symptoms
Typically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and 3 or more of the following:
visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin – such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional
a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above
generally dry skin in the last 12 months
a history of asthma or hay fever – children under 4 must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has 1 of these conditions
the condition started before the age of 2 (this does not apply to children under the age of 4)
Causes of atopic eczema
The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it's clear it is not down to one single thing.
Atopic eczema often occurs in people who get allergies. ""Atopic"" means sensitivity to allergens.
It can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever.
The symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather.
Sometimes food allergies can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema.
You may be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse.
Allergy tests are not usually needed, although they're sometimes helpful in identifying whether a food allergy may be triggering symptoms.
Treating atopic eczema
Treatment for atopic eczema can help to relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time.
But there's currently no cure and severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life, which may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally.
There's also an increased risk of skin infections.
Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including:
self-care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers
emollients (moisturising treatments) – used on a daily basis for dry skin
topical corticosteroids – used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups
Other types of eczema
Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin.
Other types of eczema include:
discoid eczema – a type of eczema that occurs in circular or oval patches on the skin
contact dermatitis – a type of eczema that occurs when the body comes into contact with a particular substance
varicose eczema – a type of eczema that most often affects the lower legs and is caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins
seborrhoeic eczema – a type of eczema where red, scaly patches develop on the sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears and scalp
dyshidrotic eczema (pompholyx) – a type of eczema that causes tiny blisters to erupt across the palms of the hands"

AI-Assistant: Bonjour, comment puis-je vous aider aujourd'hui?

Patient: J'ai entendu dire que le VIH affaiblit le système immunitaire. Qu'est-ce que cela signifie et qu'est-ce que le SIDA a à voir avec cela?
AI-Assistant: Le VIH (virus de l'immunodéficience humaine) est un virus qui attaque les cellules du système immunitaire, ce qui affaiblit votre capacité à combattre les infections et les maladies courantes. Le SIDA (syndrome d'immunodéficience acquise) est un terme utilisé pour décrire un certain nombre d'infections et de maladies potentiellement mortelles qui se produisent lorsque votre système immunitaire a été gravement endommagé par le virus VIH.

Patient: Comment est-ce que le VIH est transmis?
AI-Assistant: Le VIH est transmis principalement par contact sexuel avec une personne infectée. Il peut également être transmis par le partage de seringues infectées, la transmission de la mère à l'enfant pendant la grossesse, l'accouchement ou l'allaitement maternel.

Patient: Quels sont les symptômes de l'infection par le VIH?
AI-Assistant: La plupart des gens présentent une maladie grippale courte 2 à 6 semaines après une infection par le VIH, qui dure une semaine ou deux. Après la disparition de ces symptômes, le VIH peut ne pas causer de symptômes pendant de nombreuses années, bien que le virus continue de nuire à votre système immunitaire. Cela signifie que de nombreuses personnes atteintes du VIH ne savent pas qu'elles sont infectées. Si vous pensez que vous pourriez avoir été exposé(e) au VIH, il est important de vous faire tester.

Patient: Y a-t-il un traitement pour le VIH?
AI-Assistant: Il n'y a actuellement pas de cure pour le VIH, mais il existe des traitements médicamenteux très efficaces qui permettent à la plupart des personnes infectées de vivre une vie longue et saine. Le traitement consiste en des médicaments antirétroviraux qui empêchent le virus de se répliquer dans le corps, permettant à votre système immunitaire de se réparer et d'éviter des dommages supplémentaires.

Patient: Comment puis-je être testé(e) pour le VIH?
AI-Assistant: Vous pouvez vous faire tester chez un médecin généraliste, dans les cliniques de santé sexuelle et les cliniques gérées par des organismes de bienfaisance. Il existe des tests que vous pouvez faire à la maison ou dans des pharmacies. Si votre premier test suggère que vous avez le VIH, un autre test sanguin sera nécessaire pour confirmer le résultat.

Patient: Y a-t-il des moyens de prévenir l'infection par le VIH?
AI-Assistant: Il existe de nombreuses façons efficaces de prévenir ou de réduire le risque d'infection par le VIH, notamment l'utilisation d'un préservatif pour les rapports sexuels, le traitement pour réduire la charge virale à indétectable. Si vous utilisez des drogues, il est important de ne jamais partager des aiguilles ou du matériel d'injection, y compris des seringues, des cuillères et des tampons d'alcool.

HIV and AIDS
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system and weakens your ability to fight everyday infections and disease.
AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus.
While AIDS cannot be transmitted from 1 person to another, the HIV virus can.
There's currently no cure for HIV, but there are very effective drug treatments that enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life.
With an early diagnosis and effective treatments, most people with HIV will not develop any AIDS-related illnesses and will live a near-normal lifespan.
Symptoms of HIV infection
Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after HIV infection, which lasts for a week or 2.
After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years, although the virus continues to damage your immune system.
This means many people with HIV do not know they're infected.
Anyone who thinks they could have HIV should get tested.
Some people are advised to have regular tests as they're at particularly high risk.
Read more about who's most at risk of HIV
Causes of HIV infection
HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person. This includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood and breast milk.
It's a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long.
HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat, urine or saliva.
The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through having anal or vaginal sex without a condom.
Other ways of getting HIV include:
sharing needles, syringes or other injecting equipment
transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding
The chance of getting HIV through oral sex is very low and will be dependent on many things, such as whether you receive or give oral sex and the oral hygiene of the person giving the oral sex.
Diagnosing HIV
Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV.
You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities.
Find HIV testing services near you
The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection.
It's important to be aware that:
emergency anti-HIV medicine called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may stop you becoming infected if started within 72 hours of possible exposure to the virus – it's recommended that you start it as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours
an early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the virus, reduce the risk of becoming more unwell and reduce the chance of passing the virus on to others
Both positive and negative HIV tests may need to be repeated 1 to 3 months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the window period), but you should not wait this long to seek help:
clinics may offer a finger prick blood test, which can give you a result in minutes, but it may take up to a few days to get the results of a more detailed HIV test
home testing or home sampling kits are available to buy online or from pharmacies – depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few days
If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result.
If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options.
Treatment for HIV
Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage.
These come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day.
HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV medicine very easily, but taking a combination of different medicines makes this much less likely.
Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines. It's vital these are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.
The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load. This means the level of HIV virus in your body is low enough to not be detected by a test.
Living with HIV
If you're living with HIV, taking effective HIV treatment and being undetectable significantly reduces your risk of passing HIV on to others.
You'll also be encouraged to:
take regular exercise
eat a healthy diet
stop smoking
have yearly flu jabs to minimise the risk of getting serious illnesses
Without treatment, the immune system will become severely damaged, and life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and severe infections can occur.
If you're planning on getting pregnant, it's important to talk to a GP. Although rare, it's possible to transmit HIV to your baby.
Preventing HIV
Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV infection.
There are many effective ways to prevent or reduce the risk of HIV infection, including:
using a condom for sex
post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
treatment for HIV to reduce the viral load to undetectable
if you use drugs, never sharing needles or other injecting equipment, including syringes, spoons and swabs
Speak to your local sexual health clinic or a GP for further advice about the best way to reduce your risk.
For people with HIV, if you have been taking effective HIV treatment and your viral load has been undetectable for 6 months or more, it means you cannot pass the virus on through sex.
This is called undetectable=untransmittable (U=U).

Heart attack
A heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI) is a serious medical emergency in which the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked, usually by a blood clot.
A heart attack is a medical emergency. Call 999 and ask for an ambulance if you suspect a heart attack.
A lack of blood to the heart may seriously damage the heart muscle and can be life threatening.
Symptoms of a heart attack
Symptoms of a heart attack can include:
chest pain – a feeling of pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across your chest
pain in other parts of the body – it can feel as if the pain is spreading from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and tummy
feeling lightheaded or dizzy
sweating
shortness of breath
feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)
an overwhelming feeling of anxiety (similar to a panic attack)
coughing or wheezing
The chest pain is often severe, but some people may only experience minor pain, similar to indigestion.
While the most common symptom in both men and women is chest pain, women are more likely to have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, feeling or being sick and back or jaw pain.
Call 999 immediately if you think someone might be having a heart attack. The faster you act, the better their chances.
Treating heart attacks
While waiting for an ambulance, it may help to chew and then swallow a tablet of aspirin (ideally 300mg), as long as the person having a heart attack is not allergic to aspirin.
Aspirin helps to thin the blood and improves blood flow to the heart.
In hospital, treatment for a heart attack depends on how serious it is.
The 2 main treatments are:
using medicines to dissolve blood clots
surgery to help restore blood to the heart
Causes of a heart attack
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart attacks.
CHD is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart get clogged with deposits of cholesterol, known as plaques.
Before a heart attack, 1 of the plaques bursts (ruptures), causing a blood clot to develop at the site of the rupture.
The clot may block the supply of blood to the heart, triggering a heart attack.
Recovering from a heart attack
The time it takes to recover from a heart attack will depend on the amount of damage to your heart muscle.
Most people can return to work after having a heart attack. Some people are well enough to return to work after 2 weeks. Other people may take several months to recover. How quickly you can go back to work depends on your health, the state of your heart and the type of work you do.
The recovery process aims to:
reduce your risk of another heart attack through a combination of lifestyle changes (such as eating a healthy diet), and medicines (such as statins), which help to lower blood cholesterol levels
gradually restore your physical fitness so you can resume normal activities (cardiac rehabilitation)
Find out more about recovering from a heart attack
Complications of a heart attack
Complications of a heart attack can be serious and possibly life threatening.
These include:
arrhythmias – these are abnormal heartbeats. 1 type is where the heart begins beating faster and faster, then stops beating (cardiac arrest)
cardiogenic shock – where the heart's muscles are severely damaged and can no longer contract properly to supply enough blood to maintain many body functions
heart rupture – where the heart's muscles, walls or valves split apart (rupture)
These complications can happen quickly after a heart attack and are a leading cause of death.
Many people die suddenly from a complication of a heart attack before reaching hospital or within the 1st month after a heart attack.
The outlook often depends on:
age – serious complications are more likely as you get older
the severity of the heart attack – how much of the heart's muscle has been damaged during the attack
how long it took before a person received treatment – treatment for a heart attack should begin as soon as possible
Find out more about complications of a heart attack
Preventing a heart attack
There are 5 main steps you can take to reduce your risk of having a heart attack (or having another heart attack):
smokers should quit smoking
lose weight if you're overweight or obese
do regular exercise – adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week, unless advised otherwise by the doctor in charge of your care
eat a low-fat, high-fibre diet, including wholegrains and at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day
moderate your alcohol consumption

an irritating cough that does not go away
always needing to clear your throat
a sore throat
Children can also:
have a temperature of 38C or above
be off their food or drink
have difficulty breathing (but this is rare)
Laryngitis is often linked to other illnesses, such as colds and flu, so you may also have other symptoms.

try to speak as little as possible
drink plenty of fluids
keep the air moist by putting out bowls of water – central heating and air conditioning make the air dry
gargle with warm salty water (children should not try this)
Don’t
do not talk loudly or whisper – both strain your voice
do not smoke
do not spend time in smoky or dusty places
do not drink too much caffeine or alcohol – they cause dehydration
How to gargle with salty water
Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water. Warm water helps salt dissolve.
Gargle with the solution then spit it out. Do not swallow it.
Repeat as often as you like.
This is not suitable for younger children.
A pharmacist can help with laryngitis
Speak to a pharmacist about your sore throat.
They can give advice and suggest treatments, including:
paracetamol or ibuprofen
cough syrup to help with your cough
solutions to gargle or lozenges for the pain
Find a pharmacy
Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
your symptoms do not improve after 2 weeks
it's very painful or it's difficult to swallow
you keep getting laryngitis or voice problems
What happens at your appointment
The GP will try to work out what has caused your laryngitis.
They may:
look inside your throat using a small mirror
wipe a cotton bud around the back of your throat for testing
arrange a blood test
refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist (if you keep getting laryngitis)
If your laryngitis is caused by an infection, the GP might prescribe antibiotics.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if:
you or your child are having difficulty breathing

What causes laryngitis
Laryngitis usually happens when you have an infection from a virus, such as cold or flu. A flu vaccination will help prevent you getting flu.
Other things that cause laryngitis include:
allergies to things like dust and fumes
acid from your stomach coming up your throat (acid reflux)
coughing over a long time
clearing your throat all the time"

1;Qu'est-ce que la sclérose en plaques ?;La sclérose en plaques (SEP) est une maladie qui peut affecter le cerveau et la moelle épinière, causant une grande variété de symptômes potentiels, tels que des problèmes de vision, de mouvement des bras et des jambes, de sensation ou d'équilibre. C'est une condition à vie qui peut parfois causer une invalidité grave, bien qu'elle puisse parfois être légère. Dans de nombreux cas, il est possible de traiter les symptômes. L'espérance de vie moyenne est légèrement réduite pour les personnes atteintes de SEP. Elle est plus courante chez les personnes dans la vingtaine, la trentaine et la quarantaine, bien qu'elle puisse se développer à tout âge. Elle est environ deux à trois fois plus courante chez les femmes que chez les hommes.
2;Quels sont les symptômes de la sclérose en plaques ?;Les symptômes de la sclérose en plaques varient largement d'une personne à l'autre et peuvent affecter n'importe quelle partie du corps. Les principaux symptômes incluent : la fatigue, les difficultés à marcher, les problèmes de vision, tels que la vision floue, les problèmes de contrôle de la vessie, les engourdissements ou les picotements dans différentes parties du corps, la raideur et les spasmes musculaires, les problèmes d'équilibre et de coordination, les problèmes de réflexion, d'apprentissage et de planification. Selon le type de SEP que vous avez, vos symptômes peuvent aller et venir par phases ou s'aggraver progressivement avec le temps. 
3;Comment traiter la sclérose en plaques ?;Il n'existe actuellement aucun traitement curatif pour la SEP, mais un certain nombre de traitements peuvent aider à contrôler la condition et à soulager les symptômes. Le traitement dont vous avez besoin dépendra des symptômes et des difficultés spécifiques que vous rencontrez. Il peut inclure : le traitement des rechutes avec de courtes cures de médicaments à base de stéroïdes pour accélérer la guérison, des traitements spécifiques pour les symptômes individuels de la SEP, un traitement pour réduire le nombre de rechutes en utilisant des médicaments appelés thérapies modifiant la maladie. Ces thérapies peuvent également aider à ralentir ou à réduire l'aggravation globale de l'invalidité chez les personnes atteintes de la forme de SEP appelée la forme récurrente-rémittente et chez certaines personnes atteintes de la forme appelée la forme progressive primaire et secondaire qui ont des rechutes. Malheureusement, il n'existe actuellement aucun traitement qui puisse ralentir la progression de la SEP progressive primaire ou secondaire, où il n'y a pas de rechutes.
4;Comment diagnostique-t-on la sclérose en plaques ?;Consultez un médecin généraliste (GP) si vous êtes préoccupé par des signes de SEP. Les symptômes ont souvent de nombreuses autres causes, ils ne sont donc pas nécessairement un signe de SEP. Faites connaître au GP le schéma spécifique de symptômes que vous éprouvez. S'ils pensent que vous pourriez avoir la SEP, vous serez orienté vers un spécialiste des conditions du système nerveux (un neurologue), qui peut suggérer des tests tels qu'une imagerie par résonance magnétique (IRM) pour rechercher des caractéristiques de la SEP. 
5;Quels groupes de soutien et associations existent pour la sclérose en plaques ?;Il existe deux principales associations pour la sclérose en plaques au Royaume-Uni : la MS Society et la MS Trust. Ces organisations offrent des conseils utiles, des publications, des articles d'actualité sur la recherche en cours, des blogs et des salles de discussion. Elles peuvent être très utiles si vous ou une personne que vous connaissez vient d'être diagnostiquée avec la SEP.

Multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that can affect the brain and spinal cord, causing a wide range of potential symptoms, including problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance.
It's a lifelong condition that can sometimes cause serious disability, although it can occasionally be mild.
In many cases, it's possible to treat symptoms. Average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with MS.
It's most commonly diagnosed in people in their 20s, 30s and 40s although it can develop at any age. It's about 2 to 3 times more common in women than men.
MS is one of the most common causes of disability in younger adults.
Symptoms of multiple sclerosis
The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person and can affect any part of the body.
The main symptoms include:
fatigue
difficulty walking
vision problems, such as blurred vision
problems controlling the bladder
numbness or tingling in different parts of the body
muscle stiffness and spasms
problems with balance and co-ordination
problems with thinking, learning and planning
Depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms may come and go in phases or get steadily worse over time (progress).
Getting medical advice
See a GP if you're worried you might have signs of MS.
The symptoms often have many other causes, so they're not necessarily a sign of MS.
Let the GP know about the specific pattern of symptoms you're experiencing.
If they think you could have MS, you'll be referred to a specialist in conditions of the nervous system (a neurologist), who may suggest tests such as an MRI scan to check for features of MS.

Types of multiple sclerosis
MS starts in 1 of 2 general ways: with individual relapses (attacks or exacerbations) or with gradual progression.
Relapsing remitting MS
Between 8 and 9 of every 10 people with MS are diagnosed with the relapsing remitting type.
Someone with relapsing remitting MS will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, known as relapses.
These typically worsen over a few days, last for days to weeks to months, then slowly improve over a similar time period.
Relapses often occur without warning, but are sometimes associated with a period of illness or stress.
The symptoms of a relapse may disappear altogether, with or without treatment, although some symptoms often persist, with repeated attacks happening over several years.
Periods between attacks are known as periods of remission. These can last for years at a time.
After many years (usually decades), many, but not all, people with relapsing remitting MS go on to develop secondary progressive MS.
In this type of MS, symptoms gradually worsen over time without obvious attacks. Some people continue to have infrequent relapses during this stage.
About two-thirds of people with relapsing remitting MS will develop secondary progressive MS.
Primary progressive MS
Between 1 and 2 in every 10 people with the condition start their MS with a gradual worsening of symptoms.
In primary progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and accumulate over several years, and there are no periods of remission, though people often have periods where their condition appears to stabilise.
What causes multiple sclerosis?
MS is an autoimmune condition. This is when something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks a healthy part of the body – in this case, the brain or spinal cord of the nervous system.
In MS, the immune system attacks the layer that surrounds and protects the nerves called the myelin sheath.
This damages and scars the sheath, and potentially the underlying nerves, meaning that messages travelling along the nerves become slowed or disrupted.
Exactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is unclear, but most experts think a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved.
Treatments for multiple sclerosis
There's currently no cure for MS, but a number of treatments can help control the condition and ease symptoms.
The treatment you need will depend on the specific symptoms and difficulties you have.
It may include:
treating relapses with short courses of steroid medicine to speed up recovery
specific treatments for individual MS symptoms
treatment to reduce the number of relapses using medicines called disease-modifying therapies
Disease-modifying therapies may also help to slow or reduce the overall worsening of disability in people with a type of MS called relapsing remitting MS, and in some people with types called primary and secondary progressive MS, who have relapses.
Unfortunately, there's currently no treatment that can slow the progress of primary progressive MS, or secondary progressive MS, where there are no relapses.
Many therapies aiming to treat progressive MS are currently being researched.
Living with multiple sclerosis
If you have been diagnosed with MS, it's important to take care of your general health.
Read more advice about living with MS
Outlook
MS can be a challenging condition to live with, but new treatments over the past 20 years have considerably improved the quality of life of people with the condition.
MS itself is rarely fatal, but complications may arise from severe MS, such as chest or bladder infections, or swallowing difficulties.
The average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average, and this gap appears to be getting smaller all the time.
Charities and support groups for multiple sclerosis
There are 2 main MS charities in the UK:
MS Society
MS Trust
These organisations offer useful advice, publications, news items about ongoing research, blogs and chatrooms.
They can be very useful if you, or someone you know, has just been diagnosed with MS.
There's also the shift.ms website, an online community for younger people affected by MS.

40,"ID;Question;Answer
1;What is high blood pressure and what are the risks associated with it?;High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, refers to the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body (systolic pressure) and the resistance to that blood flow in the blood vessels (diastolic pressure). If left untreated, high blood pressure can put extra strain on your heart, blood vessels, and other organs such as the brain, kidneys and eyes. This can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening health conditions like heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysms, kidney disease and vascular dementia.
2;What are some of the lifestyle factors that contribute to high blood pressure?;There are a number of lifestyle factors that can increase your risk of developing high blood pressure, including being overweight, eating too much salt and not enough fruit and vegetables, not engaging in enough physical exercise, consuming too much alcohol or caffeine-based drinks, smoking, having disturbed sleep or not getting enough sleep, coming from a black African or black Caribbean background, living in a deprived area or having a relative with high blood pressure.
3;How is high blood pressure diagnosed and what is considered the ideal blood pressure?;High blood pressure is diagnosed by taking a blood pressure test. This involves recording your systolic and diastolic pressures, which are measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The ideal blood pressure is between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg, while the target for those over 80 is below 150/90mmHg (or 145/85mmHg at home). High blood pressure is considered to be from 140/90mmHg (or an average of 135/85mmHg at home) – or 150/90mmHg (or an average of 145/85mmHg at home) if you're over the age of 80.
4;What are some ways to lower blood pressure naturally?;There are a number of lifestyle changes that can help lower high blood pressure, including reducing the amount of salt you eat and adopting a generally healthy diet, cutting back on alcohol, losing weight if you are overweight, exercising regularly, cutting down on caffeine and stopping smoking. These changes can be beneficial in preventing high blood pressure from developing or helping those with high blood pressure to lower their blood pressure.
5;What should I do if I have high blood pressure?;If you have high blood pressure, talking to your doctor is the first step to finding the right treatment options. Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes such as exercise and diet changes, or a medication to help control your blood pressure. Understanding your treatment options and discussing them with your doctor can help you make an informed decision.
6;How often should I get my blood pressure checked?;All adults over 40 are advised to have their blood pressure checked at least every 5 years. However, if you have a family history of high blood pressure, have already been diagnosed with high blood pressure, or exhibit certain lifestyle factors that could increase your risk, you should get your blood pressure checked more frequently – at least once a year.
7;What are the most common medications used to treat high blood pressure?;There are a number of different medications that can help control high blood pressure, including ACE inhibitors (such as enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril, and ramipril), angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) (such as candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, valsartan, and olmesartan), calcium channel blockers (such as amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil), diuretics (such as indapamide and bendroflumethiazide), beta blockers (such as atenolol and bisoprolol), alpha blockers (such as doxazosin), and other diuretics (such as amiloride and spironolactone). The medication that is recommended for you will depend on things like how high your blood pressure is, your age and your ethnicity.
8;What is the first step to finding out if I have high blood pressure?;The only way to determine if you have high blood pressure is to have your blood pressure checked. You can get this done at a number of places, including your GP surgery, some pharmacies, as part of your NHS Health Check, or in some workplaces. You can also check your blood pressure yourself with a home blood pressure monitor.
9;What are the benefits of reducing blood pressure?;Reducing your blood pressure, even by a small amount, can significantly reduce your risk of developing serious and potentially life-threatening health conditions like heart disease, heart attacks, stroke, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysms, kidney disease and vascular dementia. Adopting healthy lifestyle changes and adhering to a treatment plan can help mitigate these risks.
10;Can certain foods and supplements help lower high blood pressure?;While there is no single food or supplement that can lower high blood pressure on its own, there is scientific evidence to suggest that certain foods and supplements may play a role in lowering blood pressure in combination with medication or lifestyle changes. Some examples include foods high in potassium such as bananas, avocado, and sweet potatoes, omega-3 fatty acids found in fatty fish like salmon and mackerel, and supplements like magnesium and Coenzyme Q10. It is important to talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian before making changes to your diet or taking any supplements.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,0,f53cf99826,7889f126e5e27c68bc03654e07b6c45c13c5808d248056b2bd5fe8a051ccb62c,"Overview
High blood pressure (hypertension)
High blood pressure, or hypertension, rarely has noticeable symptoms. But if untreated, it increases your risk of serious problems such as heart attacks and strokes.
Around a third of adults in the UK have high blood pressure, although many will not realise it.
The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have your blood pressure checked.
What is high blood pressure?
Blood pressure is recorded with 2 numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body.
The diastolic pressure (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels.
They're both measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg).
As a general guide:
high blood pressure is considered to be from 140/90mmHg (or an average of 135/85mmHg at home) – or 150/90mmHg (or an average of 145/85mmHg at home) if you're over the age of 80
ideal blood pressure is usually considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg, while the target for over-80s is below 150/90mmHg (or 145/85mmHg at home)
Blood pressure readings between 120/80mmHg and 140/90mmHg could mean you're at risk of developing high blood pressure if you do not take steps to keep your blood pressure under control.
Everyone's blood pressure will be slightly different. What's considered low or high for you may be normal for someone else.
Risks of high blood pressure
If your blood pressure is too high, it puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes.
Persistent high blood pressure can increase your risk of a number of serious and potentially life-threatening health conditions, such as:
heart disease
heart attacks
strokes
heart failure
peripheral arterial disease
aortic aneurysms
kidney disease
vascular dementia
If you have high blood pressure, reducing it even a small amount can help lower your risk of these health conditions.
Check your blood pressure
The only way of knowing whether you have high blood pressure is to have a blood pressure test.
All adults over 40 are advised to have their blood pressure checked at least every 5 years.
Getting this done is easy and could save your life.
You can get your blood pressure tested at a number of places, including:
at your GP surgery
at some pharmacies
as part of your NHS Health Check
in some workplaces
You can also check your blood pressure yourself with a home blood pressure monitor.
Find out more about getting a blood pressure test
Things that can increase your risk of getting high blood pressure
It's not always clear what causes high blood pressure, but there are things that can increase your risk.
You might be more at risk if you:
are overweight
eat too much salt and do not eat enough fruit and vegetables
do not do enough exercise
drink too much alcohol or coffee (or other caffeine-based drinks)
smoke
do not get much sleep or have disturbed sleep
are over 65
have a relative with high blood pressure
are of black African or black Caribbean descent
live in a deprived area
Making healthy lifestyle changes can sometimes help reduce your chances of getting high blood pressure and help lower your blood pressure if it's already high.
Treatment for high blood pressure
Doctors can help you keep your blood pressure to a safe level using:
lifestyle changes
medicines
What works best is different for each person.
Talk to your doctor to help you decide about treatment.
This patient decision aid (PDF, 132kb) can also help you to understand your treatment options.
Lifestyle changes to reduce blood pressure
These lifestyle changes can help prevent and lower high blood pressure:
reduce the amount of salt you eat and have a generally healthy diet
cut back on alcohol
lose weight if you're overweight
exercise regularly
cut down on caffeine
stop smoking
Some people with high blood pressure may also need to take 1 or more medicines to stop their blood pressure getting too high.
Medicines for high blood pressure
If you're diagnosed with high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend taking 1 or more medicines to keep it under control.
These come as tablets and usually need to be taken once a day.
Common blood pressure medicines include:
ACE inhibitors – such as enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril
angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) – such as candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, valsartan and olmesartan
calcium channel blockers – such as amlodipine, felodipine and nifedipine or diltiazem and verapamil
diuretics – such as indapamide and bendroflumethiazide
beta blockers – such as atenolol and bisoprolol
alpha blockers – such as doxazosin
other diuretics – such as amiloride and spironolactone

41,"ID;Question;Answer
1;What is bronchiolitis?;Bronchiolitis is a common chest infection that affects babies and children under 2 years of age. It is caused by a viral infection, usually the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The symptoms are similar to a cold, including a runny or blocked nose, cough, and high temperature. Bronchiolitis is different from bronchitis, which occurs more commonly in adults and causes severe coughing with lots of mucus.
2;What are the symptoms of bronchiolitis?;The early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to a cold, such as sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, a cough, and a slightly high temperature of 38°C. Children with bronchiolitis may also experience rapid breathing, difficulty feeding or eating, noisy breathing (wheezing), and irritability. These symptoms are usually most severe between days 3 and 5, and the cough typically gets better within 3 weeks.
3;How is bronchiolitis treated?;There is no specific treatment for bronchiolitis. It usually gets better on its own and can be treated at home. However, in some cases, hospital treatment may be necessary, especially if the child is experiencing difficulty breathing or persistently high fever. To treat the symptoms of bronchiolitis, children's paracetamol or ibuprofen can be given depending on the child’s age. You can also use saline drops to unblock the child's nose, encourage fluids, and keep the child upright to help them breathe more easily. 
4;When should I seek immediate medical attention for my child with bronchiolitis?;If your child is having difficulty breathing, you may notice grunting noises, tummy sucking under the ribs, pauses when breathing, and blue skin, tongue, or lips. If your child is floppy and unresponsive, or if he or she cannot wake up or stay awake, you should call 999 or go to A&E immediately. These are all signs of severe or life-threatening bronchiolitis.
5;What should I do if my child has had a cold and is getting worse?;If your child has had a cold and the symptoms are getting worse, you should ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111. Your child may need medical attention if he or she is feeding or eating much less than usual, has had a dry nappy for 12 hours, is showing any signs of dehydration or has a high fever. If your baby is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38°C or older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39°C or higher, seek medical help immediately. Also, if your child is very tired or irritable, you should seek medical attention.
6;What are the precautions to take to prevent bronchiolitis?;To prevent bronchiolitis, you should wash your hands regularly and keep your child's hands clean as well. Clean surfaces and toys regularly to prevent the spread of the virus. Use disposable tissues and dispose of them immediately after use. Ensure that you keep your newborn babies away from anyone with a cold or the flu, especially if they're under 2 months old or were premature. Never smoke around your child as children who breathe in cigarette smoke are at higher risk of getting bronchiolitis.
7;What are the long-term effects of bronchiolitis?;Bronchiolitis usually resolves without causing any severe long-term effects. However, some children may be at greater risk for developing asthma later in life. Children who have had severe bronchiolitis may develop respiratory problems, including wheezing or frequent or severe asthma symptoms, especially if they have a family history of asthma.
8;Who is at higher risk of developing severe bronchiolitis?;Children who were born very prematurely, have a heart or lung condition, or have a weakened immune system are at higher risk for developing severe bronchiolitis. Premature babies, in particular, are at risk because their lungs may not have fully developed at the time of birth, which can make them more susceptible to respiratory infections such as bronchiolitis.
9;What is the difference between bronchiolitis and bronchitis?;Bronchiolitis is a chest infection that affects babies and young children under 2 years of age and is caused by a viral infection, while bronchitis is a common respiratory infection that causes inflammation of the airways, primarily in adults. A cough with lots of mucus characterizes bronchitis and can affect people of all ages. Bronchiolitis and bronchitis share some symptoms, but they are different conditions.
10;Can bronchiolitis be transmitted from person to person?;Yes, bronchiolitis is contagious and is spread through the respiratory secretions of an infected person, such as coughing and sneezing. The virus can also survive on surfaces and objects, and a person can be infected by touching these surfaces and then touching their nose or mouth. It is essential to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, particularly in children who may be more susceptible to severe symptoms of the illness.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,0,f53cf99826,86e5b584ceed031250268ffa1835d1474ed886a31d93f76ab6286a184a7915d6,"Bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is a common chest infection that affects babies and children under 2. It's usually mild and can be treated at home, but it can be serious.
Bronchiolitis is different from bronchitis, which causes a cough with lots of mucus and can affect people of all ages.
Check if it's bronchiolitis
The early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to a cold, such as sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, a cough and a slightly high temperature of 38C.
A child with bronchiolitis may then get other symptoms, such as:
breathing more quickly
finding it difficult to feed or eat
noisy breathing (wheezing)
becoming irritable
Symptoms are usually worst between days 3 and 5, and the cough usually gets better in 3 weeks.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if:
your child is having difficulty breathing – you may notice grunting noises or their tummy sucking under their ribs
there are pauses when your child breathes
your child's skin, tongue or lips are blue
your child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake
As a parent, you may know if your child seems seriously unwell and should trust your own judgement.
Find your nearest A&E
Urgent advice:
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if:
your child has had a cold and it's getting worse
your child is feeding or eating much less than normal
your child has had a dry nappy for 12 hours or more, or shows other signs of dehydration
your baby is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38C, or is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39C or higher
your baby feels hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, or feels sweaty
your child is very tired or irritable
Treatments for bronchiolitis
There's no specific treatment for bronchiolitis. It usually gets better on its own and you can look after your child at home.
But it can be serious in some children, who may need to be treated in hospital.
Do
give children's paracetamol to babies and children over 2 months old or ibuprofen to babies and children over 3 months old – but do not give aspirin to a child under 16
try using salt water (saline) drops if your child's nose is blocked
keep your child upright as much as possible when they're awake – this will help them breathe more easily
encourage your child to drink lots of fluids – try smaller feeds more often in babies, and give older children extra water or diluted fruit juice
Don’t
do not smoke around your child
do not try to lower your child's temperature by sponging them with cool water or taking off all their clothes
Preventing bronchiolitis
There are some things you can do to lower the chances of your child getting bronchiolitis or spreading the viruses that cause it, such as:
wash your hands and your child's hands often
wash or wipe down toys and clean surfaces regularly
use disposable tissues and throw them away as soon as you've used them
keep newborn babies away from anyone with a cold or the flu – especially if they're under 2 months old or were premature
It's also important not to smoke around your child. Children who breathe in cigarette smoke have a higher risk of getting bronchiolitis.
Children at risk of severe bronchiolitis
Some children may have a higher risk of getting seriously ill with bronchiolitis.
This includes children who:
were born very prematurely
have a heart or lung condition
have a weakened immune system
These children may be able to have treatment in the winter (between October and March) to stop them getting severe bronchiolitis.
Causes of bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is caused by a viral infection, usually the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
RSV is very common and spreads easily in coughs and sneezes. Almost all children have had it by the time they're 2.
In older children and adults, RSV may cause a cough or cold, but in young children it can cause bronchiolitis."
42,"ID;Question;Answer
1;What is bronchitis?;Bronchitis is inflammation of the airways in the lungs that is typically caused by a viral or bacterial infection. It is characterized by coughing, difficulty breathing, chest pain when coughing, sore throat, and runny nose. Bronchitis can also develop into chronic bronchitis or COPD in some cases.
2;What are the symptoms of bronchitis?;The symptoms of bronchitis are similar to those of a cold or flu. They include a cough that may produce clear, white, yellow or green mucus, chest pain when coughing, shortness of breath, sore throat, runny nose, and high temperature. If you experience any of these symptoms, it is advisable to see a GP.
3;What are the things that I can do to help with bronchitis?;If you have bronchitis, you can take certain measures to ease the symptoms. These include getting plenty of rest, drinking plenty of fluids, taking painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen, adding honey to a warm drink to soothe your throat, covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, and washing your hands regularly with water and soap. Smoking is not recommended.
4;When should I ask for urgent GP appointment for bronchitis?;You should ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if you experience symptoms of bronchitis such as a cough that persists for more than 3 weeks, coughing up blood or blood-stained mucus, chest pain that comes and goes or occurs while breathing or coughing, you're over 65, pregnant, or have a long-term condition such as diabetes, heart, lung or kidney conditions, or if you feel very unwell.
5;What is the treatment for bronchitis?;In most cases, bronchitis will clear up without treatment in about 3 weeks. If the cause is bacterial, antibiotics may be prescribed by your GP. In general, treating the symptoms with over-the-counter painkillers, plenty of rest, and drinking lots of fluids will help you recover from bronchitis.
6;How can I reduce the risk of spreading bronchitis to others?;To reduce the risk of spreading bronchitis, make sure to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, put used tissues in the bin as quickly as possible, and wash your hands regularly with water and soap. Avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or do not feel well enough to do your normal activities.
7;Am I at risk of bronchitis if I have a weakened immune system?;Yes, if you have a weakened immune system or a condition that affects your immune system, you are at increased risk of bronchitis. Examples of such conditions include undergoing chemotherapy, having HIV or AIDS, or being a transplant recipient.

Bronchitis is inflammation of the airways in the lungs that is usually caused by an infection. It often gets better without treatment in around 3 weeks.
Some people have long-term inflammation of the airways in the lungs called chronic bronchitis. This is known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Check if you have bronchitis
Symptoms of bronchitis can be similar to a cold or flu.
Symptoms include:
a cough – you may cough up clear, white, yellow or green mucus
chest pain when coughing
shortness of breath
a sore throat
a runny nose
a high temperature
Things you can do to help with bronchitis
There are some things you can do to ease the symptoms of bronchitis and reduce the risk of spreading infections to other people.
Do
get plenty of rest – try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or do not feel well enough to do your normal activities
drink plenty of fluids
take painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen to help with pain and bring down a high temperature
try adding honey to a warm drink to help soothe your throat (do not give honey to babies under 1)
cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze – put used tissues in the bin as quickly as possible
wash your hands regularly with water and soap
Don’t
do not smoke
Urgent advice:
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:
you've had a cough for more than 3 weeks
you cough up blood or blood-stained mucus
you have chest pain that comes and goes, or when breathing or coughing
you're over 65
you're pregnant
you have a long-term condition, such as diabetes, or a heart, lung or kidney condition
you have a weakened immune system – for example, you have a condition that affects the immune system, or you're having chemotherapy
you feel very unwell
Immediate action required:
Call 999 if:
you are struggling to breathe – you are choking, gasping and unable to speak
you have pale, blue or blotchy skin, lips or tongue – on brown or black skin, this may be easier to see on the lips, tongue or gums, under the nails or around the eyes
you suddenly feel confused – for example, you do not know where you are
you're unable to wake your baby or they feel floppy
Treatments for bronchitis
Bronchitis usually clears up without treatment in around 3 weeks. See a GP if your symptoms last longer than 3 weeks.
You may need antibiotics if your bronchitis is caused by a bacterial infection."

1;What is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and fatal condition that affects the brain. It causes brain damage that worsens rapidly over time.
2;What are the symptoms of CJD?;Symptoms of CJD include: loss of intellect and memory, changes in personality, loss of balance and co-ordination, slurred speech, vision problems and blindness, abnormal jerking movements, and progressive loss of brain function and mobility. Most people with CJD will die within a year of the symptoms starting, usually from infection.
3;What causes CJD?;CJD appears to be caused by an abnormal infectious protein called a prion. These prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells. While the abnormal prions are technically infectious, they're very different from viruses and bacteria.
4;How is sporadic CJD caused?;Sporadic CJD is the most common type of CJD. The precise cause of sporadic CJD is unclear, but it's been suggested that a normal brain protein changes abnormally (""misfolds"") and turns into a prion. Most cases of sporadic CJD occur in adults aged between 45 and 75. On average, symptoms develop between the ages of 60 and 65.
5;What is variant CJD?;Variant CJD (vCJD) is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or ""mad cow"" disease), a similar prion disease to CJD. Since the link between variant CJD and BSE was discovered in 1996, strict controls have proved very effective in preventing meat from infected cattle entering the food chain.
6;What is familial or inherited CJD?;Familial CJD is a very rare genetic condition where one of the genes a person inherits from their parent (the prion protein gene) carries a mutation that causes prions to form in their brain during adulthood, triggering the symptoms of CJD. It affects about 1 in every 9 million people in the UK. The symptoms of familial CJD usually first develop in people when they're in their early 50s.
7;What is iatrogenic CJD?;Iatrogenic CJD is where the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment. For example, a common cause of iatrogenic CJD in the past was growth hormone treatment using human pituitary growth hormones extracted from deceased individuals, some of whom were infected with CJD. Synthetic versions of human growth hormone have been used since 1985, so this is no longer a risk.
8;How is CJD treated?;There's currently no cure for CJD, so treatment aims to relieve symptoms and make the affected person feel as comfortable as possible. This can include using medicine such as antidepressants to help with anxiety and depression, and painkillers to relieve pain. Some people will need nursing care and assistance with feeding.
9;What is the incubation period for variant CJD?;The incubation period for variant CJD after initial infection is still unclear, but it could be very long (more than 10 years) in some people, so those exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced can still develop variant CJD.
10;Is there a compensation scheme for UK victims of variant CJD?;Yes, in October 2001, the government announced a compensation scheme for UK victims of variant CJD. The vCJD Trust assesses claims and pays compensation to victims and their families.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,0,f53cf99826,d7570f14c10ff8059593f6721f7b528d40e1c8ca7cf5d6f6dd74aeed2ab7367c,"Overview

Most people with CJD will die within a year of the symptoms starting, usually from infection.
This is because the immobility caused by CJD can make people with the condition vulnerable to infection.
Read more about the symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and diagnosing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
What causes CJD?
CJD appears to be caused by an abnormal infectious protein called a prion. These prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells.
While the abnormal prions are technically infectious, they're very different from viruses and bacteria.
For example, prions aren't destroyed by the extremes of heat and radiation used to kill bacteria and viruses, and antibiotics or antiviral medicines have no effect on them.
Read more about the causes of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Types of CJD
There are 4 main types of CJD.
Sporadic CJD
Sporadic CJD is the most common type.
The precise cause of sporadic CJD is unclear, but it's been suggested that a normal brain protein changes abnormally (""misfolds"") and turns into a prion.
Most cases of sporadic CJD occur in adults aged between 45 and 75. On average, symptoms develop between the ages of 60 and 65.
Despite being the most common type of CJD, sporadic CJD is still very rare, affecting only 1 or 2 people in every million each year in the UK.
In 2020, there were 131 recorded deaths from sporadic CJD in the UK.
Variant CJD
Variant CJD (vCJD) is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or ""mad cow"" disease), a similar prion disease to CJD.
Since the link between variant CJD and BSE was discovered in 1996, strict controls have proved very effective in preventing meat from infected cattle entering the food chain.
See preventing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease for more information.
But the average time it takes for the symptoms of variant CJD to occur after initial infection (the incubation period) is still unclear.
The incubation period could be very long (more than 10 years) in some people, so those exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced can still develop variant CJD.
The prion that causes variant CJD can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, although this has only happened 5 times in the UK.
In 2020, there were no recorded deaths from variant CJD in the UK.
Familial or inherited CJD
Familial CJD is a very rare genetic condition where one of the genes a person inherits from their parent (the prion protein gene) carries a mutation that causes prions to form in their brain during adulthood, triggering the symptoms of CJD.
It affects about 1 in every 9 million people in the UK.
The symptoms of familial CJD usually first develop in people when they're in their early 50s.
In 2020, there were 6 deaths from familial CJD and similar inherited prion diseases in the UK.
Iatrogenic CJD
Iatrogenic CJD is where the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment.
For example, a common cause of iatrogenic CJD in the past was growth hormone treatment using human pituitary growth hormones extracted from deceased individuals, some of whom were infected with CJD.
Synthetic versions of human growth hormone have been used since 1985, so this is no longer a risk.
Iatrogenic CJD can also occur if instruments used during brain surgery on a person with CJD aren't properly cleaned between each surgical procedure and are reused on another person.
But increased awareness of these risks means iatrogenic CJD is now very rare.
In 2020, there was 1 death from iatrogenic CJD in the UK caused by receiving human growth hormone before 1985.
How CJD is treated
There's currently no cure for CJD, so treatment aims to relieve symptoms and make the affected person feel as comfortable as possible.
This can include using medicine such as antidepressants to help with anxiety and depression, and painkillers to relieve pain.
Some people will need nursing care and assistance with feeding.

44,"Patient: Hi, I'm a bit worried about my health. I've been feeling sick lately and I'm not sure what's going on.

AI-Assistant: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling sick?

Patient: I've been experiencing flu-like symptoms for the past week or so. I'm feeling really tired all the time, and I've had fever, chills, and body aches.

AI-Assistant: I understand. Those symptoms can be concerning. Have you recently been tested for HIV?

Patient: No, I haven't. Why would that be relevant?

AI-Assistant: HIV can cause flu-like symptoms, especially during the early stages of infection. It's important to get tested if you think you might have been exposed.

Patient: How is HIV transmitted?

AI-Assistant: HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person, including semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood, and breast milk. The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through having anal or vaginal sex without a condom. It can also be transmitted through sharing needles, syringes, or other injecting equipment (like during drug use) or from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding.

Patient: That sounds scary. Can HIV be cured?

AI-Assistant: Unfortunately, there's currently no cure for HIV, but there are very effective drug treatments that enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life. With an early diagnosis and effective treatments, most people with HIV will not develop any AIDS-related illnesses and will live a near-normal lifespan.

Patient: How is HIV diagnosed?

AI-Assistant: The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection. You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics, and clinics run by charities.

Patient: And if the test results come back positive?

AI-Assistant: If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result. If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options. It's important to know that taking effective HIV treatment and being undetectable significantly reduces your risk of passing HIV on to others. 

Patient: That's good to know. Is there anything I can do to prevent HIV infection?

AI-Assistant: Yes, there are many effective ways to prevent or reduce the risk of HIV infection, including using a condom for sex, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), treatment for HIV to reduce the viral load to undetectable, and if you use drugs, never sharing needles or other injecting equipment, including syringes, spoons, and swabs. Speak to your local sexual health clinic or a GP for further advice about the best way to reduce your risk.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,0,f4df95ec69,83d81ca6a637bba1edb0b5f887efb96e1b1a4e2e336849929661e44e9500154e,"Overview
HIV and AIDS
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system and weakens your ability to fight everyday infections and disease.
AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus.
While AIDS cannot be transmitted from 1 person to another, the HIV virus can.
There's currently no cure for HIV, but there are very effective drug treatments that enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life.
With an early diagnosis and effective treatments, most people with HIV will not develop any AIDS-related illnesses and will live a near-normal lifespan.
Symptoms of HIV infection
Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after HIV infection, which lasts for a week or 2.
After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years, although the virus continues to damage your immune system.
This means many people with HIV do not know they're infected.
Anyone who thinks they could have HIV should get tested.
Some people are advised to have regular tests as they're at particularly high risk.
Read more about who's most at risk of HIV
Causes of HIV infection
HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person. This includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood and breast milk.
It's a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long.
HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat, urine or saliva.
The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through having anal or vaginal sex without a condom.
Other ways of getting HIV include:
sharing needles, syringes or other injecting equipment
transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding
The chance of getting HIV through oral sex is very low and will be dependent on many things, such as whether you receive or give oral sex and the oral hygiene of the person giving the oral sex.
Diagnosing HIV
Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV.
You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities.
Find HIV testing services near you
The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection.
It's important to be aware that:
emergency anti-HIV medicine called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may stop you becoming infected if started within 72 hours of possible exposure to the virus – it's recommended that you start it as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours
an early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the virus, reduce the risk of becoming more unwell and reduce the chance of passing the virus on to others
Both positive and negative HIV tests may need to be repeated 1 to 3 months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the window period), but you should not wait this long to seek help:
clinics may offer a finger prick blood test, which can give you a result in minutes, but it may take up to a few days to get the results of a more detailed HIV test
home testing or home sampling kits are available to buy online or from pharmacies – depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few days
If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result.
If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options.
Treatment for HIV
Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage.
These come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day.
HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV medicine very easily, but taking a combination of different medicines makes this much less likely.
Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines. It's vital these are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.
The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load. This means the level of HIV virus in your body is low enough to not be detected by a test.
Living with HIV
If you're living with HIV, taking effective HIV treatment and being undetectable significantly reduces your risk of passing HIV on to others.
You'll also be encouraged to:
take regular exercise
eat a healthy diet
stop smoking
have yearly flu jabs to minimise the risk of getting serious illnesses
Without treatment, the immune system will become severely damaged, and life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and severe infections can occur.
If you're planning on getting pregnant, it's important to talk to a GP. Although rare, it's possible to transmit HIV to your baby.
Preventing HIV
Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV infection.
There are many effective ways to prevent or reduce the risk of HIV infection, including:
using a condom for sex
post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
treatment for HIV to reduce the viral load to undetectable
if you use drugs, never sharing needles or other injecting equipment, including syringes, spoons and swabs
Speak to your local sexual health clinic or a GP for further advice about the best way to reduce your risk.
For people with HIV, if you have been taking effective HIV treatment and your viral load has been undetectable for 6 months or more, it means you cannot pass the virus on through sex.
This is called undetectable=untransmittable (U=U).

45,"ID;Question;Answer
1;What is a heart attack?;A heart attack, also known as myocardial infarction (MI), is a serious medical emergency in which the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked, often by a blood clot, leading to serious damage to the heart muscle and even death if left untreated.
2;What are the symptoms of a heart attack?;The symptoms of a heart attack include chest pain, pain in other parts of the body like arms, jaw, neck, back and tummy, lightheadedness, dizziness, sweating, shortness of breath, feeling nauseous and anxious, coughing or wheezing. While the most common symptom in both men and women is chest pain, women are more likely to have other symptoms.
3;What should I do if I suspect someone is having a heart attack?;If you suspect someone is having a heart attack, you should immediately call 999 or seek emergency medical help. It is important to act quickly as the faster the response and treatment, the better the chances of survival and recovery.
4;What causes a heart attack?;The leading cause of heart attacks is coronary heart disease (CHD), which results from the build-up of cholesterol deposits (plaques) on the major blood vessels that supply the heart. When one of these plaques ruptures, it causes a blood clot to form and block the blood supply to the heart, leading to a heart attack.
5;How are heart attacks treated?;The treatment for heart attacks depends on how serious the condition is. In hospital, the two main treatments are using medicines to dissolve blood clots and surgery to help restore blood flow to the heart. Before medical help arrives, chewing and then swallowing a tablet of aspirin (ideally 300mg) can help to thin the blood and improve blood flow to the heart, as long as the person is not allergic to aspirin.
6;What are the complications of a heart attack?;There are several possible complications of a heart attack, including arrhythmias (abnormal heartbeats), cardiogenic shock (heart's muscles not contracting properly to supply enough blood), and heart rupture (muscles, walls or valves splitting apart). These complications can be serious and possibly life-threatening, and often depend on factors like age, the severity of the heart attack, and the time it took to receive treatment.
7;How long does it take to recover from a heart attack?;The time it takes to recover from a heart attack depends on the extent of damage to the heart muscle, but most people can return to work afterward. Some people are well enough to return to work after two weeks, while others may take several months to recover. The recovery process aims to reduce the risk of another heart attack through lifestyle changes and medicines, and gradually restore physical fitness so that normal activities can resume.
8;What are the risk factors for a heart attack?;The risk factors for a heart attack include smoking, being overweight or obese, lack of regular exercise, a diet high in fat and low in fiber, consuming too much alcohol, and having a family history of heart disease. Controllable factors like lifestyle changes and proper medical care can lower the risk of a heart attack.
9;What is the outlook for someone who has experienced a heart attack?;The outlook after a heart attack depends on several factors, including age, the extent of damage to the heart muscle, and how quickly treatment was received. Many people die suddenly from complications of a heart attack before reaching the hospital or within the first month afterward. However, with early recognition and proper treatment, many people can make a full recovery and reduce the risk of another heart attack.
10;How can I prevent a heart attack?;There are five main steps you can take to reduce the risk of having or experiencing another heart attack: quit smoking, maintain a healthy weight through regular exercise and a low-fat, high-fiber diet, reduce alcohol consumption, manage stress, and follow proper medical care and treatment. These lifestyle changes can help to lower cholesterol levels, improve blood flow to the heart, and reduce the risk of heart attacks and other heart-related conditions.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,0,f53cf99826,efaa4f4339c0fbc713f21fa745524fd4bbdd04a5f075fccd8c1cb8e744355615,"Overview
Heart attack
A heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI) is a serious medical emergency in which the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked, usually by a blood clot.
A heart attack is a medical emergency. Call 999 and ask for an ambulance if you suspect a heart attack.
A lack of blood to the heart may seriously damage the heart muscle and can be life threatening.
Symptoms of a heart attack
Symptoms of a heart attack can include:
chest pain – a feeling of pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across your chest
pain in other parts of the body – it can feel as if the pain is spreading from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and tummy
feeling lightheaded or dizzy
sweating
shortness of breath
feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)
an overwhelming feeling of anxiety (similar to a panic attack)
coughing or wheezing
The chest pain is often severe, but some people may only experience minor pain, similar to indigestion.
While the most common symptom in both men and women is chest pain, women are more likely to have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, feeling or being sick and back or jaw pain.
Call 999 immediately if you think someone might be having a heart attack. The faster you act, the better their chances.
Treating heart attacks
While waiting for an ambulance, it may help to chew and then swallow a tablet of aspirin (ideally 300mg), as long as the person having a heart attack is not allergic to aspirin.
Aspirin helps to thin the blood and improves blood flow to the heart.
In hospital, treatment for a heart attack depends on how serious it is.
The 2 main treatments are:
using medicines to dissolve blood clots
surgery to help restore blood to the heart
Causes of a heart attack
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart attacks.
CHD is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart get clogged with deposits of cholesterol, known as plaques.
Before a heart attack, 1 of the plaques bursts (ruptures), causing a blood clot to develop at the site of the rupture.
The clot may block the supply of blood to the heart, triggering a heart attack.
Recovering from a heart attack
The time it takes to recover from a heart attack will depend on the amount of damage to your heart muscle.
Most people can return to work after having a heart attack. Some people are well enough to return to work after 2 weeks. Other people may take several months to recover. How quickly you can go back to work depends on your health, the state of your heart and the type of work you do.
The recovery process aims to:
reduce your risk of another heart attack through a combination of lifestyle changes (such as eating a healthy diet), and medicines (such as statins), which help to lower blood cholesterol levels
gradually restore your physical fitness so you can resume normal activities (cardiac rehabilitation)
Find out more about recovering from a heart attack
Complications of a heart attack
Complications of a heart attack can be serious and possibly life threatening.
These include:
arrhythmias – these are abnormal heartbeats. 1 type is where the heart begins beating faster and faster, then stops beating (cardiac arrest)
cardiogenic shock – where the heart's muscles are severely damaged and can no longer contract properly to supply enough blood to maintain many body functions
heart rupture – where the heart's muscles, walls or valves split apart (rupture)
These complications can happen quickly after a heart attack and are a leading cause of death.
Many people die suddenly from a complication of a heart attack before reaching hospital or within the 1st month after a heart attack.
The outlook often depends on:
age – serious complications are more likely as you get older
the severity of the heart attack – how much of the heart's muscle has been damaged during the attack
how long it took before a person received treatment – treatment for a heart attack should begin as soon as possible
Find out more about complications of a heart attack
Preventing a heart attack
There are 5 main steps you can take to reduce your risk of having a heart attack (or having another heart attack):
smokers should quit smoking
lose weight if you're overweight or obese
do regular exercise – adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week, unless advised otherwise by the doctor in charge of your care
eat a low-fat, high-fibre diet, including wholegrains and at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day
moderate your alcohol consumption

Laryngitis is when your voice box or vocal cords in the throat become irritated or swollen. It usually goes away by itself within 1 to 2 weeks.
Check if you have laryngitis
Laryngitis usually comes on suddenly and gets worse during the first 3 days.
The main symptoms are:
a hoarse (croaky) voice
sometimes losing your voice
an irritating cough that does not go away
always needing to clear your throat
a sore throat
Children can also:
have a temperature of 38C or above
be off their food or drink
have difficulty breathing (but this is rare)
Laryngitis is often linked to other illnesses, such as colds and flu, so you may also have other symptoms.
If you're not sure it's laryngitis, check other sore throat symptoms.
How you can treat laryngitis yourself
Laryngitis usually goes away on its own after 1 to 2 weeks and you do not need to see a GP.
Do
try to speak as little as possible
drink plenty of fluids
keep the air moist by putting out bowls of water – central heating and air conditioning make the air dry
gargle with warm salty water (children should not try this)
Don’t
do not talk loudly or whisper – both strain your voice
do not smoke
do not spend time in smoky or dusty places
do not drink too much caffeine or alcohol – they cause dehydration
How to gargle with salty water
Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water. Warm water helps salt dissolve.
Gargle with the solution then spit it out. Do not swallow it.
Repeat as often as you like.
This is not suitable for younger children.
A pharmacist can help with laryngitis
Speak to a pharmacist about your sore throat.
They can give advice and suggest treatments, including:
paracetamol or ibuprofen
cough syrup to help with your cough
solutions to gargle or lozenges for the pain
Find a pharmacy
Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
your symptoms do not improve after 2 weeks
it's very painful or it's difficult to swallow
you keep getting laryngitis or voice problems
What happens at your appointment
The GP will try to work out what has caused your laryngitis.
They may:
look inside your throat using a small mirror
wipe a cotton bud around the back of your throat for testing
arrange a blood test
refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist (if you keep getting laryngitis)

What causes laryngitis
Laryngitis usually happens when you have an infection from a virus, such as cold or flu. A flu vaccination will help prevent you getting flu.
Other things that cause laryngitis include:
allergies to things like dust and fumes
acid from your stomach coming up your throat (acid reflux)
coughing over a long time
clearing your throat all the time"
47,"Patient: Hi,

AI-Assistant: Hello there! How can I assist you today?

Patient: I've been experiencing some weird symptoms lately, like fatigue and difficulty walking. Could it be multiple sclerosis?

AI-Assistant: Multiple sclerosis can cause those symptoms, but they can also be caused by other conditions. I suggest consulting a GP and letting them know about the specific pattern of symptoms you're experiencing.

Patient: Okay, thank you. Is MS a rare condition?

AI-Assistant: No, MS is not a rare condition. In fact, it's one of the most common causes of disability in younger adults.

Patient: What are the types of MS?

AI-Assistant: MS starts in 1 of 2 general ways - with individual relapses (attacks or exacerbations) or with gradual progression. The two main types are relapsing remitting MS and primary progressive MS.

Patient: What causes MS?

AI-Assistant: MS is an autoimmune condition, which means the immune system attacks a healthy part of the body - in this case, the brain or spinal cord of the nervous system. The exact cause of MS is unclear, but experts believe a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved.

Patient: Is there a cure for MS?

AI-Assistant: There's currently no cure for MS, but a number of treatments can help control the condition and ease symptoms. However, many therapies aiming to treat progressive MS are currently being researched.

Patient: Can MS be fatal?

AI-Assistant: MS itself is rarely fatal, but complications may arise from severe MS, such as chest or bladder infections, or swallowing difficulties. The average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average, and this gap appears to be getting smaller all the time.

Patient: Where can I get more information and support about MS?

AI-Assistant: There are two main MS charities in the UK - MS Society and MS Trust. These organisations offer useful advice, publications, news items about ongoing research, blogs, and chat rooms. There's also the shift.ms website, an online community for younger people affected by MS.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,0,f4df95ec69,35346eac08c4608b519b5fa72cf1aa0833e0c957503cf2f8905b7e1dfcd1f02b,"Overview
Multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that can affect the brain and spinal cord, causing a wide range of potential symptoms, including problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance.
It's a lifelong condition that can sometimes cause serious disability, although it can occasionally be mild.
In many cases, it's possible to treat symptoms. Average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with MS.
It's most commonly diagnosed in people in their 20s, 30s and 40s although it can develop at any age. It's about 2 to 3 times more common in women than men.
MS is one of the most common causes of disability in younger adults.
Symptoms of multiple sclerosis
The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person and can affect any part of the body.
The main symptoms include:
fatigue
difficulty walking
vision problems, such as blurred vision
problems controlling the bladder
numbness or tingling in different parts of the body
muscle stiffness and spasms
problems with balance and co-ordination
problems with thinking, learning and planning
Depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms may come and go in phases or get steadily worse over time (progress).
Getting medical advice
See a GP if you're worried you might have signs of MS.
The symptoms often have many other causes, so they're not necessarily a sign of MS.
Let the GP know about the specific pattern of symptoms you're experiencing.
If they think you could have MS, you'll be referred to a specialist in conditions of the nervous system (a neurologist), who may suggest tests such as an MRI scan to check for features of MS.

Types of multiple sclerosis
MS starts in 1 of 2 general ways: with individual relapses (attacks or exacerbations) or with gradual progression.
Relapsing remitting MS
Between 8 and 9 of every 10 people with MS are diagnosed with the relapsing remitting type.
Someone with relapsing remitting MS will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, known as relapses.
These typically worsen over a few days, last for days to weeks to months, then slowly improve over a similar time period.
Relapses often occur without warning, but are sometimes associated with a period of illness or stress.
The symptoms of a relapse may disappear altogether, with or without treatment, although some symptoms often persist, with repeated attacks happening over several years.
Periods between attacks are known as periods of remission. These can last for years at a time.
After many years (usually decades), many, but not all, people with relapsing remitting MS go on to develop secondary progressive MS.
In this type of MS, symptoms gradually worsen over time without obvious attacks. Some people continue to have infrequent relapses during this stage.
About two-thirds of people with relapsing remitting MS will develop secondary progressive MS.
Primary progressive MS
Between 1 and 2 in every 10 people with the condition start their MS with a gradual worsening of symptoms.
In primary progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and accumulate over several years, and there are no periods of remission, though people often have periods where their condition appears to stabilise.
What causes multiple sclerosis?
MS is an autoimmune condition. This is when something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks a healthy part of the body – in this case, the brain or spinal cord of the nervous system.
In MS, the immune system attacks the layer that surrounds and protects the nerves called the myelin sheath.
This damages and scars the sheath, and potentially the underlying nerves, meaning that messages travelling along the nerves become slowed or disrupted.
Exactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is unclear, but most experts think a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved.
Treatments for multiple sclerosis
There's currently no cure for MS, but a number of treatments can help control the condition and ease symptoms.
The treatment you need will depend on the specific symptoms and difficulties you have.
It may include:
treating relapses with short courses of steroid medicine to speed up recovery
specific treatments for individual MS symptoms
treatment to reduce the number of relapses using medicines called disease-modifying therapies
Disease-modifying therapies may also help to slow or reduce the overall worsening of disability in people with a type of MS called relapsing remitting MS, and in some people with types called primary and secondary progressive MS, who have relapses.
Unfortunately, there's currently no treatment that can slow the progress of primary progressive MS, or secondary progressive MS, where there are no relapses.
Many therapies aiming to treat progressive MS are currently being researched.
Living with multiple sclerosis
If you have been diagnosed with MS, it's important to take care of your general health.

Outlook
MS can be a challenging condition to live with, but new treatments over the past 20 years have considerably improved the quality of life of people with the condition.
MS itself is rarely fatal, but complications may arise from severe MS, such as chest or bladder infections, or swallowing difficulties.
The average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average, and this gap appears to be getting smaller all the time.
Charities and support groups for multiple sclerosis
There are 2 main MS charities in the UK:
MS Society
MS Trust
These organisations offer useful advice, publications, news items about ongoing research, blogs and chatrooms.
They can be very useful if you, or someone you know, has just been diagnosed with MS.
There's also the shift.ms website, an online community for younger people affected by MS.

49,"ID;Question;Answer
1;Qu'est-ce que les stéroïdes et dans quels cas sont-ils utilisés?;Les stéroïdes, aussi appelés corticostéroïdes, sont des médicaments anti-inflammatoires utilisés pour traiter un large éventail de conditions telles que l'asthme, la maladie inflammatoire de l'intestin, la polyarthrite rhumatoïde et le lupus. Ils peuvent être sous forme de comprimés, d'inhalateurs, de sprays nasaux, d'injections ou de crèmes. Les stéroïdes sont différents des stéroïdes anabolisants, qui sont souvent utilisés illégalement pour augmenter la masse musculaire.
2;Quels sont les effets secondaires des stéroïdes et sont-ils dangereux?;Les stéroïdes ont tendance à ne pas causer d'effets secondaires significatifs s'ils sont pris pendant une courte période ou à faible dose. Cependant, ils peuvent parfois causer des effets secondaires désagréables, tels qu'une augmentation de l'appétit, des changements d'humeur et des difficultés à dormir. Les effets secondaires sont souvent temporaires et disparaissent à la fin du traitement. Cependant, il ne faut pas arrêter un traitement prescrit sans en parler au médecin, car cela peut causer d'autres effets secondaires désagréables (symptômes de sevrage).
3;Comment fonctionnent les stéroïdes et comment aident-ils à soulager les douleurs et l'inflammation?;Les stéroïdes sont une version synthétique des hormones normalement produites par les glandes surrénales qui se trouvent au-dessus des reins. Lorsqu'ils sont pris en doses supérieures à la quantité normalement produite par le corps, les stéroïdes réduisent les rougeurs et l'enflure (inflammation). Cela peut aider à traiter les maladies inflammatoires telles que l'asthme et l'eczéma. Les stéroïdes réduisent également l'activité du système immunitaire, qui est la défense naturelle du corps contre les maladies et les infections.
4;Quelles sont les différentes formes de stéroïdes et lesquelles sont disponibles sans ordonnance médicale?;Les stéroïdes se présentent sous de nombreuses formes différentes, telles que des comprimés, des sirops, des inhalateurs, des sprays nasaux, des injections et des crèmes. La plupart des stéroïdes ne sont disponibles que sur ordonnance médicale, mais quelques-uns (comme certains crèmes ou sprays nasaux) peuvent être achetés en pharmacie sans ordonnance.
5;Comment peut-on signaler un effet secondaire suspecté dû à la prise de stéroïdes?;Le programme de cartes jaunes est un moyen de signaler tout effet secondaire suspecté de médicaments, y compris les stéroïdes. Vous pouvez signaler en ligne via le site Web du programme ou demander une carte de signalement à votre pharmacien ou votre médecin. Les notifications peuvent également être faites par téléphone ou par courrier.
6;Les stéroïdes peuvent-ils causer une augmentation de poids?;Oui, les stéroïdes peuvent causer une augmentation de poids en raison de l'augmentation de l'appétit qu'ils peuvent provoquer. Cependant, cela peut être évité en suivant un régime alimentaire équilibré et en faisant régulièrement de l'exercice physique.
7;Quand doit-on éviter la prise de stéroïdes?;Les stéroïdes peuvent ne pas être recommandés si vous avez des infections non traitées, certains types de cancer, des ulcères d'estomac ou une condition appelée insuffisance surrénale. Il est important de parler à votre médecin si vous avez des préoccupations ou des questions sur la prise de stéroïdes.
8;Les stéroïdes peuvent-ils guérir des maladies telles que l'asthme ou la polyarthrite rhumatoïde?;Bien que les stéroïdes ne puissent pas guérir des maladies comme l'asthme ou la polyarthrite rhumatoïde, ils peuvent aider à soulager les symptômes en réduisant l'inflammation et la douleur. Les stéroïdes sont souvent utilisés en combinaison avec d'autres médicaments pour traiter ces conditions.
9;Comment les stéroïdes sont-ils administrés pour soulager les douleurs articulaires?;Les stéroïdes peuvent être administrés par injection dans les articulations pour aider à soulager la douleur et l'inflammation causées par des maladies telles que l'arthrite et la tendinite. Ces injections sont généralement données sous anesthésie locale et peuvent nécessiter plusieurs prises pour un soulagement complet.
10;Comment les stéroïdes pour l'asthme sont-ils administrés?;Les stéroïdes pour l'asthme peuvent être administrés par inhalation à l'aide d'un inhalateur. Les inhalateurs de stéroïdes agissent en réduisant l'inflammation des voies respiratoires et en augmentant leur capacité à transférer l'air. Des inhalateurs doseurs ou des inhalateurs à poudre sèche peuvent être utilisés pour administrer les stéroïdes, en fonction de la préférence du patient et de la prescription médicale.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,French,0,f53cf99826,4cee5f75c109bcb942cc5ba47525be1a08030d274ed3020b8412a575afd65e3a,"Steroids
Steroids, also called corticosteroids, are anti-inflammatory medicines used to treat a range of conditions.
They're different from anabolic steroids, which are often used illegally by some people to increase their muscle mass.
Types of steroids
Steroids come in many different forms.
The main types are:
tablets, syrups and liquids – such as prednisolone
inhalers – such as beclometasone and fluticasone
nasal sprays – such as beclometasone and fluticasone
injections (given into joints, muscles or blood vessels) – such as methylprednisolone
creams, lotions and gels – such as hydrocortisone skin cream
Most steroids are only available on prescription, but a few (such as some creams or nasal sprays) can be bought from pharmacies and shops.
Side effects of steroids
Steroids do not tend to cause significant side effects if they're taken for a short time or at a low dose.
But sometimes they can cause unpleasant side effects, such as an increased appetite, mood changes and difficulty sleeping. This is most common with steroid tablets.
The side effects will usually pass once you finish the treatment, but do not stop taking your medicine without speaking to your doctor. Stopping a prescribed course of medicine can cause further unpleasant side effects (withdrawal symptoms).
Read more about:
side effects of steroid tablets
side effects of steroid inhalers
side effects of steroid nasal sprays
side effects of steroid injections

You can report any suspected side effect to the Yellow Card Scheme.
Uses for steroids
Steroids can be used to treat a wide range of conditions, including:
asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
hay fever
hives and eczema
painful joints or muscles – such as arthritis, tennis elbow and frozen shoulder
pain caused by an irritated or trapped nerve – such as sciatica
inflammatory bowel disease – such as Crohn's disease
lupus
multiple sclerosis (MS)
How steroids work
Steroids are a man-made version of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands which are 2 small glands found above the kidneys.
When taken in doses higher than the amount your body normally produces, steroids reduce redness and swelling (inflammation). This can help with inflammatory conditions such as asthma and eczema.
Steroids also reduce the activity of the immune system, which is the body's natural defence against illness and infection.
This can help treat autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body."

AI-Assistant: Bonjour ! En quoi puis-je vous aider aujourd'hui ?

Patient: J'ai entendu parler de la maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob. Pouvez-vous m'en dire plus sur cette maladie ?
AI-Assistant: Bien sûr ! La maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob est une maladie rare et fatale qui affecte le cerveau. Elle cause des dommages cérébraux qui s'aggravent rapidement avec le temps.

Patient: Quels sont les symptômes de la maladie de CJD ?
AI-Assistant: Les symptômes de la maladie de CJD incluent une perte d'intelligence et de mémoire, des changements de personnalité, une perte d'équilibre et de coordination, une parole confuse, des problèmes de vision et de l'aveuglement, des mouvements anormaux tels que des convulsions et une perte progressive des fonctions cérébrales et de la mobilité.

Patient: Quelles sont les causes de la maladie de CJD ?
AI-Assistant: Il semble que la maladie de CJD soit causée par une protéine infectieuse anormale appelée prion. Ces prions s'accumulent à des niveaux élevés dans le cerveau et causent des dommages irréversibles aux cellules nerveuses.

Patient: Il existe différents types de maladie de CJD, n'est-ce pas ?
AI-Assistant: Tout à fait. Il y a quatre types principaux de CJD: sporadique, variant, familiale ou héréditaire, et iatrogène.

Patient: Quel est le type de CJD le plus commun ?
AI-Assistant: Le type le plus commun de CJD est le sporadique CJD. La cause précise de ce type de CJD est incertaine, mais on pense qu'une protéine cérébrale normale change anormalement et se transforme en un prion.

Patient: Y-a-t-il un traitement pour la maladie de CJD?
AI-Assistant: Malheureusement, il n'y a pas de remède pour la maladie de CJD. Le traitement vise à soulager les symptômes et à rendre la personne concernée aussi à l'aise que possible. Cela peut inclure l'utilisation de médicaments tels que des antidépresseurs pour aider l'anxiété et la dépression, et des analgésiques pour soulager la douleur.

Patient: Peut-on prévenir la maladie de CJD ?
AI-Assistant: La maladie de CJD ne peut pas être prévenue à 100%. Cependant, il existe des mesures préventives pour réduire les risques de l'attraper. Pour le variant CJD, il est recommandé d'éviter de manger de la viande de vache qui a été infectée par l'encéphalopathie spongiforme bovine.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and fatal condition that affects the brain. It causes brain damage that worsens rapidly over time.
Symptoms of CJD
Symptoms of CJD include:
loss of intellect and memory
changes in personality
loss of balance and co-ordination
slurred speech
vision problems and blindness
abnormal jerking movements
progressive loss of brain function and mobility
Most people with CJD will die within a year of the symptoms starting, usually from infection.
This is because the immobility caused by CJD can make people with the condition vulnerable to infection.
Read more about the symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and diagnosing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
What causes CJD?
CJD appears to be caused by an abnormal infectious protein called a prion. These prions accumulate at high levels in the brain and cause irreversible damage to nerve cells.
While the abnormal prions are technically infectious, they're very different from viruses and bacteria.
For example, prions aren't destroyed by the extremes of heat and radiation used to kill bacteria and viruses, and antibiotics or antiviral medicines have no effect on them.
Read more about the causes of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Types of CJD
There are 4 main types of CJD.
Sporadic CJD
Sporadic CJD is the most common type.
The precise cause of sporadic CJD is unclear, but it's been suggested that a normal brain protein changes abnormally (""misfolds"") and turns into a prion.
Most cases of sporadic CJD occur in adults aged between 45 and 75. On average, symptoms develop between the ages of 60 and 65.
Despite being the most common type of CJD, sporadic CJD is still very rare, affecting only 1 or 2 people in every million each year in the UK.
In 2020, there were 131 recorded deaths from sporadic CJD in the UK.
Variant CJD
Variant CJD (vCJD) is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or ""mad cow"" disease), a similar prion disease to CJD.
Since the link between variant CJD and BSE was discovered in 1996, strict controls have proved very effective in preventing meat from infected cattle entering the food chain.
See preventing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease for more information.
But the average time it takes for the symptoms of variant CJD to occur after initial infection (the incubation period) is still unclear.
The incubation period could be very long (more than 10 years) in some people, so those exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced can still develop variant CJD.
The prion that causes variant CJD can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, although this has only happened 5 times in the UK.
In 2020, there were no recorded deaths from variant CJD in the UK.
Familial or inherited CJD
Familial CJD is a very rare genetic condition where one of the genes a person inherits from their parent (the prion protein gene) carries a mutation that causes prions to form in their brain during adulthood, triggering the symptoms of CJD.
It affects about 1 in every 9 million people in the UK.
The symptoms of familial CJD usually first develop in people when they're in their early 50s.
In 2020, there were 6 deaths from familial CJD and similar inherited prion diseases in the UK.
Iatrogenic CJD
Iatrogenic CJD is where the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment.
For example, a common cause of iatrogenic CJD in the past was growth hormone treatment using human pituitary growth hormones extracted from deceased individuals, some of whom were infected with CJD.
Synthetic versions of human growth hormone have been used since 1985, so this is no longer a risk.
Iatrogenic CJD can also occur if instruments used during brain surgery on a person with CJD aren't properly cleaned between each surgical procedure and are reused on another person.
But increased awareness of these risks means iatrogenic CJD is now very rare.
In 2020, there was 1 death from iatrogenic CJD in the UK caused by receiving human growth hormone before 1985.
How CJD is treated
There's currently no cure for CJD, so treatment aims to relieve symptoms and make the affected person feel as comfortable as possible.
This can include using medicine such as antidepressants to help with anxiety and depression, and painkillers to relieve pain.
Some people will need nursing care and assistance with feeding.

Atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most common form of eczema, a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, dry and cracked.
Atopic eczema is more common in children, often developing before their first birthday. But it may also develop for the first time in adults.
It's usually a long-term (chronic) condition, although it can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older.
Symptoms of atopic eczema
Atopic eczema causes the skin to become itchy, dry, cracked and sore.
Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread inflamed skin all over the body.
Inflamed skin can become red on lighter skin, and darker brown, purple or grey on darker skin. This can also be more difficult to see on darker skin.
Although atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, it most often affects the hands, insides of the elbows, backs of the knees and the face and scalp in children.
People with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups).
When to seek medical advice
See a GP if you have symptoms of atopic eczema. They'll usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions, such as:
whether the rash is itchy and where it appears
when the symptoms first began
whether it comes and goes over time
whether there's a history of atopic eczema in your family
whether you have any other conditions, such as allergies or asthma
whether something in your diet or lifestyle may be contributing to your symptoms
Typically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and 3 or more of the following:
visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin – such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional
a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above
generally dry skin in the last 12 months
a history of asthma or hay fever – children under 4 must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has 1 of these conditions
the condition started before the age of 2 (this does not apply to children under the age of 4)
Causes of atopic eczema
The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it's clear it is not down to one single thing.
Atopic eczema often occurs in people who get allergies. ""Atopic"" means sensitivity to allergens.
It can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever.
The symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather.
Sometimes food allergies can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema.
You may be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse.
Allergy tests are not usually needed, although they're sometimes helpful in identifying whether a food allergy may be triggering symptoms.
Treating atopic eczema
Treatment for atopic eczema can help to relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time.
But there's currently no cure and severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life, which may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally.
There's also an increased risk of skin infections.
Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including:
self-care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers
emollients (moisturising treatments) – used on a daily basis for dry skin
topical corticosteroids – used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups
Other types of eczema
Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin.
Other types of eczema include:
discoid eczema – a type of eczema that occurs in circular or oval patches on the skin
contact dermatitis – a type of eczema that occurs when the body comes into contact with a particular substance
varicose eczema – a type of eczema that most often affects the lower legs and is caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins
seborrhoeic eczema – a type of eczema where red, scaly patches develop on the sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears and scalp
dyshidrotic eczema (pompholyx) – a type of eczema that causes tiny blisters to erupt across the palms of the hands"

1;Qu'est-ce que la laryngite?;La laryngite est une inflammation des cordes vocales ou du larynx qui se traduit par une voix rauque ou enrouée, une toux irritante, une gorge douloureuse et des difficultés à avaler. Elle est souvent causée par une infection virale comme le rhume ou la grippe.
2;Comment savoir si j'ai une laryngite?;Les symptômes typiques de la laryngite sont une voix rauque ou enrouée, une toux irritante, une sensation de gorge douloureuse et un besoin fréquent de se racler la gorge. Les enfants peuvent avoir de la fièvre, des difficultés à respirer et un manque d'appétit. Si vous n'êtes pas sûr, vérifiez les autres symptômes de la douleur à la gorge.
3;Comment puis-je traiter moi-même une laryngite?;La laryngite disparaît généralement d'elle-même après 1 à 2 semaines, et vous n'avez pas besoin de voir un médecin généraliste. Vous pouvez soulager vos symptômes en parlant le moins possible, en buvant beaucoup de liquides, en utilisant des solutions salines pour gargariser et en évitant de fumer et de boire de l'alcool ou de la caféine.
4;Comment puis-je me gargariser avec de l'eau salée?;Pour vous gargariser avec de l'eau salée, il suffit de dissoudre une demi-cuillère à café de sel dans un verre d'eau tiède. Gargarisez-vous avec cette solution puis recrachez-la. Il est important de ne pas l'avaler. Répétez cette opération autant de fois que vous le souhaitez. Attention, cette technique n'est pas adaptée aux jeunes enfants.
5;Quand devrais-je consulter un médecin pour ma laryngite?;Vous devriez consulter un médecin si vos symptômes persistent après 2 semaines, si vous avez de la difficulté à avaler ou si vous souffrez de douleurs intenses de la gorge. Si vous avez fréquemment des laryngites ou des problèmes de voix, il peut être judicieux de consulter un spécialiste ORL.
6;Que va-t-il se passer lors de mon rendez-vous avec un médecin pour une laryngite?;Le médecin va essayer de déterminer la cause de votre laryngite en examinant votre gorge à l'aide d'un petit miroir ou en faisant un prélèvement pour analyse. Si votre laryngite est due à une infection, le médecin peut vous prescrire des antibiotiques. Si vos laryngites sont fréquentes, une référence à un spécialiste ORL peut être envisagée.
7;Comment un pharmacien peut-il aider en cas de laryngite?;Parlez à votre pharmacien en cas de douleur à la gorge. Il peut vous donner des conseils sur les traitements à suivre pour soulager vos symptômes, comme le paracétamol ou l'ibuprofène, les sirops contre la toux ou les pastilles pour la douleur.
8;Quels sont les choses à ne pas faire lors d'une laryngite?;Il est important de ne pas parler fort ou de chuchoter, car cela fatigue votre voix. Il est également important d'éviter de fumer ou de passer du temps dans des environnements poussiéreux ou enfumés et de ne pas boire trop de caféine ou d'alcool, car cela provoque une déshydratation.
9;Pourquoi la laryngite peut-elle être liée à d'autres maladies?;La laryngite est souvent causée par une infection virale telle que le rhume ou la grippe, et peut donc être liée à d'autres symptômes de ces maladies, tels que la fièvre ou les frissons. Elle peut également être causée par des allergies ou une exposition à des substances irritantes, comme la fumée de cigarette.
10;Qu'est-ce que l'acide gastrique a à voir avec la laryngite?;L'acide gastrique qui remonte dans la gorge, également connu sous le nom de reflux acide, peut irriter les cordes vocales et causer une laryngite. Si vous souffrez de reflux acide, il est important de suivre les conseils santé pour éviter ces irritations : éviter les repas riches et gras, manger lentement, éviter les aliments acides et épicés.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,French,0,f53cf99826,d1d1f73cdfe1a44a8867eee4d06e46507e869cf22297a4494ec01253cfa37438,"Laryngitis
Laryngitis is when your voice box or vocal cords in the throat become irritated or swollen. It usually goes away by itself within 1 to 2 weeks.
Check if you have laryngitis
Laryngitis usually comes on suddenly and gets worse during the first 3 days.
The main symptoms are:
a hoarse (croaky) voice
sometimes losing your voice
an irritating cough that does not go away
always needing to clear your throat
a sore throat
Children can also:
have a temperature of 38C or above
be off their food or drink
have difficulty breathing (but this is rare)
Laryngitis is often linked to other illnesses, such as colds and flu, so you may also have other symptoms.
If you're not sure it's laryngitis, check other sore throat symptoms.
How you can treat laryngitis yourself
Laryngitis usually goes away on its own after 1 to 2 weeks and you do not need to see a GP.
Do
try to speak as little as possible
drink plenty of fluids
keep the air moist by putting out bowls of water – central heating and air conditioning make the air dry
gargle with warm salty water (children should not try this)
Don’t
do not talk loudly or whisper – both strain your voice
do not smoke
do not spend time in smoky or dusty places
do not drink too much caffeine or alcohol – they cause dehydration
How to gargle with salty water
Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water. Warm water helps salt dissolve.
Gargle with the solution then spit it out. Do not swallow it.
Repeat as often as you like.
This is not suitable for younger children.
A pharmacist can help with laryngitis
Speak to a pharmacist about your sore throat.
They can give advice and suggest treatments, including:
paracetamol or ibuprofen
cough syrup to help with your cough
solutions to gargle or lozenges for the pain
Find a pharmacy
Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
your symptoms do not improve after 2 weeks
it's very painful or it's difficult to swallow
you keep getting laryngitis or voice problems
What happens at your appointment
The GP will try to work out what has caused your laryngitis.
They may:
look inside your throat using a small mirror
wipe a cotton bud around the back of your throat for testing
arrange a blood test
refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist (if you keep getting laryngitis)
If your laryngitis is caused by an infection, the GP might prescribe antibiotics.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if:
you or your child are having difficulty breathing
Find your nearest A&E
What causes laryngitis
Laryngitis usually happens when you have an infection from a virus, such as cold or flu. A flu vaccination will help prevent you getting flu.
Other things that cause laryngitis include:
allergies to things like dust and fumes
acid from your stomach coming up your throat (acid reflux)
coughing over a long time
clearing your throat all the time"
53,"Patient: Salut !

AI-Assistant: Bonjour ! Comment puis-je vous aider ?

Patient: J'ai remarqué que j'ai des problèmes de vision ainsi que des difficultés à marcher. Je suis inquiet que ce soit la SEP. Qu'est-ce que vous en pensez ?

AI-Assistant: Les symptômes de la SEP peuvent varier d'une personne à l'autre, et il est préférable de consulter votre médecin généraliste si vous êtes inquiet. Ils pourront vous diriger vers un neurologue si nécessaire pour un examen approfondi. Avez-vous parlé à votre médecin de ces symptômes ?

Patient: Non, pas encore. Quels autres symptômes peuvent être associés à la SEP ?

AI-Assistant: Les symptômes de la SEP peuvent inclure de la fatigue, des problèmes urinaires, des engourdissements ou des picotements dans différentes parties du corps, des spasmes musculaires, des problèmes de coordination et de démarche, ainsi que des problèmes de vision. Toutefois, ces symptômes peuvent être causés par d'autres problèmes de santé, il est donc important de consulter un médecin pour un diagnostic précis.

Patient: Qu'est-ce qui cause la SEP ?

AI-Assistant: La SEP est une maladie auto-immune dans laquelle le système immunitaire attaque la gaine de myéline qui protège les nerfs du cerveau et de la moelle épinière. Les causes exactes de la SEP ne sont pas connues, mais il est suggéré qu'un mélange de facteurs génétiques et environnementaux pourrait jouer un rôle.

Multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that can affect the brain and spinal cord, causing a wide range of potential symptoms, including problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance.
It's a lifelong condition that can sometimes cause serious disability, although it can occasionally be mild.
In many cases, it's possible to treat symptoms. Average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with MS.
It's most commonly diagnosed in people in their 20s, 30s and 40s although it can develop at any age. It's about 2 to 3 times more common in women than men.
MS is one of the most common causes of disability in younger adults.
Symptoms of multiple sclerosis
The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person and can affect any part of the body.
The main symptoms include:
fatigue
difficulty walking
vision problems, such as blurred vision
problems controlling the bladder
numbness or tingling in different parts of the body
muscle stiffness and spasms
problems with balance and co-ordination
problems with thinking, learning and planning
Depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms may come and go in phases or get steadily worse over time (progress).
Getting medical advice
See a GP if you're worried you might have signs of MS.
The symptoms often have many other causes, so they're not necessarily a sign of MS.
Let the GP know about the specific pattern of symptoms you're experiencing.
If they think you could have MS, you'll be referred to a specialist in conditions of the nervous system (a neurologist), who may suggest tests such as an MRI scan to check for features of MS.
Find out more about diagnosing MS
Types of multiple sclerosis
MS starts in 1 of 2 general ways: with individual relapses (attacks or exacerbations) or with gradual progression.
Relapsing remitting MS
Between 8 and 9 of every 10 people with MS are diagnosed with the relapsing remitting type.
Someone with relapsing remitting MS will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, known as relapses.
These typically worsen over a few days, last for days to weeks to months, then slowly improve over a similar time period.
Relapses often occur without warning, but are sometimes associated with a period of illness or stress.
The symptoms of a relapse may disappear altogether, with or without treatment, although some symptoms often persist, with repeated attacks happening over several years.
Periods between attacks are known as periods of remission. These can last for years at a time.
After many years (usually decades), many, but not all, people with relapsing remitting MS go on to develop secondary progressive MS.
In this type of MS, symptoms gradually worsen over time without obvious attacks. Some people continue to have infrequent relapses during this stage.
About two-thirds of people with relapsing remitting MS will develop secondary progressive MS.
Primary progressive MS
Between 1 and 2 in every 10 people with the condition start their MS with a gradual worsening of symptoms.
In primary progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and accumulate over several years, and there are no periods of remission, though people often have periods where their condition appears to stabilise.
What causes multiple sclerosis?
MS is an autoimmune condition. This is when something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks a healthy part of the body – in this case, the brain or spinal cord of the nervous system.
In MS, the immune system attacks the layer that surrounds and protects the nerves called the myelin sheath.
This damages and scars the sheath, and potentially the underlying nerves, meaning that messages travelling along the nerves become slowed or disrupted.
Exactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is unclear, but most experts think a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved.
Treatments for multiple sclerosis
There's currently no cure for MS, but a number of treatments can help control the condition and ease symptoms.
The treatment you need will depend on the specific symptoms and difficulties you have.
It may include:
treating relapses with short courses of steroid medicine to speed up recovery
specific treatments for individual MS symptoms
treatment to reduce the number of relapses using medicines called disease-modifying therapies
Disease-modifying therapies may also help to slow or reduce the overall worsening of disability in people with a type of MS called relapsing remitting MS, and in some people with types called primary and secondary progressive MS, who have relapses.
Unfortunately, there's currently no treatment that can slow the progress of primary progressive MS, or secondary progressive MS, where there are no relapses.
Many therapies aiming to treat progressive MS are currently being researched.
Living with multiple sclerosis
If you have been diagnosed with MS, it's important to take care of your general health.
Read more advice about living with MS
Outlook
MS can be a challenging condition to live with, but new treatments over the past 20 years have considerably improved the quality of life of people with the condition.
MS itself is rarely fatal, but complications may arise from severe MS, such as chest or bladder infections, or swallowing difficulties.
The average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average, and this gap appears to be getting smaller all the time.
Charities and support groups for multiple sclerosis
There are 2 main MS charities in the UK:
MS Society
MS Trust
These organisations offer useful advice, publications, news items about ongoing research, blogs and chatrooms.
They can be very useful if you, or someone you know, has just been diagnosed with MS.
There's also the shift.ms website, an online community for younger people affected by MS.

54,"Patient: Hi, I'm a bit worried about my baby. He seems to have a cold, but I'm not sure if it's something more serious.

AI-Assistant: Hello. I'm here to help. What symptoms are you noticing in your baby that are making you worried?

Patient: He's been sneezing a lot, has a blocked nose, a cough, and a slightly high temperature. Are these the symptoms of a common cold?

AI-Assistant: Yes, these early symptoms of a cold are similar to those of bronchiolitis. However, it's normal for children to catch a cold, and most babies and children usually recover well from it.

Patient: That's good to know. But how do I know if it's bronchiolitis or just a regular cold?

AI-Assistant: Other symptoms your baby may have if it's bronchiolitis include breathing more quickly than normal, finding it difficult to feed or eat, noisy breathing or wheezing and becoming irritable.

Patient: That sounds serious. What should I do if I notice any of these symptoms in my child?

AI-Assistant: If you are concerned about your child's breathing like hearing grunting noises, or seeing their tummy sucking under their ribs, then it's a medical emergency, and you should call 999 or go to the A&E without delay.

Patient: What happens if I do not take quick action?

AI-Assistant: If the child does not get immediate medical attention, then the condition may worsen, requiring hospitalization or more advanced treatment.

Patient: I see. What treatment will be given to my child if it is bronchiolitis?

AI-Assistant: There's no specific treatment for bronchiolitis. However, There are things you can do at home, such as giving your child children's paracetamol or ibuprofen for pain relief and using saltwater drops to help clear their nose if it's blocked.

Patient: That's helpful to know. How do I prevent my child from getting bronchiolitis?

AI-Assistant: To reduce the risk of your child getting bronchiolitis, you can wash your hands and your child's hands often, clean surfaces regularly, use disposable tissues, and keep your baby away from anyone with a cold or the flu. Additionally, avoid smoking around your child as children who breathe in cigarette smoke have a higher risk of getting bronchiolitis.

Patient: Thanks for the advice. It has been quite helpful.

AI-Assistant: You're welcome. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,1,f4df95ec69,9ebbf3d1eae44eb0ae303fa3e1f717994566f4f511740a8f15c26280ae9a7166,"Bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is a common chest infection that affects babies and children under 2. It's usually mild and can be treated at home, but it can be serious.
Bronchiolitis is different from bronchitis, which causes a cough with lots of mucus and can affect people of all ages.
Check if it's bronchiolitis
The early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to a cold, such as sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, a cough and a slightly high temperature of 38C.
A child with bronchiolitis may then get other symptoms, such as:
breathing more quickly
finding it difficult to feed or eat
noisy breathing (wheezing)
becoming irritable
Symptoms are usually worst between days 3 and 5, and the cough usually gets better in 3 weeks.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if:
your child is having difficulty breathing – you may notice grunting noises or their tummy sucking under their ribs
there are pauses when your child breathes
your child's skin, tongue or lips are blue
your child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake
As a parent, you may know if your child seems seriously unwell and should trust your own judgement.
Find your nearest A&E
Urgent advice:
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if:
your child has had a cold and it's getting worse
your child is feeding or eating much less than normal
your child has had a dry nappy for 12 hours or more, or shows other signs of dehydration
your baby is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38C, or is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39C or higher
your baby feels hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, or feels sweaty
your child is very tired or irritable
Treatments for bronchiolitis
There's no specific treatment for bronchiolitis. It usually gets better on its own and you can look after your child at home.
But it can be serious in some children, who may need to be treated in hospital.
Do
give children's paracetamol to babies and children over 2 months old or ibuprofen to babies and children over 3 months old – but do not give aspirin to a child under 16
try using salt water (saline) drops if your child's nose is blocked
keep your child upright as much as possible when they're awake – this will help them breathe more easily
encourage your child to drink lots of fluids – try smaller feeds more often in babies, and give older children extra water or diluted fruit juice
Don’t
do not smoke around your child
do not try to lower your child's temperature by sponging them with cool water or taking off all their clothes
Preventing bronchiolitis
There are some things you can do to lower the chances of your child getting bronchiolitis or spreading the viruses that cause it, such as:
wash your hands and your child's hands often
wash or wipe down toys and clean surfaces regularly
use disposable tissues and throw them away as soon as you've used them
keep newborn babies away from anyone with a cold or the flu – especially if they're under 2 months old or were premature
It's also important not to smoke around your child. Children who breathe in cigarette smoke have a higher risk of getting bronchiolitis.
Children at risk of severe bronchiolitis
Some children may have a higher risk of getting seriously ill with bronchiolitis.
This includes children who:
were born very prematurely
have a heart or lung condition
have a weakened immune system
These children may be able to have treatment in the winter (between October and March) to stop them getting severe bronchiolitis.
Causes of bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is caused by a viral infection, usually the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
RSV is very common and spreads easily in coughs and sneezes. Almost all children have had it by the time they're 2.
In older children and adults, RSV may cause a cough or cold, but in young children it can cause bronchiolitis."

1;What are steroids used for?;Steroids can be used to treat a variety of medical conditions, such as asthma, COPD, hay fever, hives and eczema, painful joints or muscles like arthritis or frozen shoulder, pain caused by an irritated or trapped nerve like sciatica, inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, and multiple sclerosis (MS).
2;What are the different types of steroids?;Steroids come in various forms like tablets, syrups, liquids, inhalers, nasal sprays, injections, creams, lotions, and gels. Some of the commonly used steroids include prednisolone, beclometasone, fluticasone, and hydrocortisone.
3;What are the side effects of taking steroids?;When taken for a short time or at a low dose, steroids generally do not cause any significant side effects. However, some people may experience unpleasant side effects like an increased appetite, mood changes, and difficulty sleeping. The side effects are most common with steroid tablets. It's essential to speak with your doctor before stopping a prescribed course of medicine as it can cause further undesirable side effects known as withdrawal symptoms.
4;Are all steroids available only by prescription?;Most steroids are available only by prescription, but some like certain creams or nasal sprays can be bought from pharmacies and shops.
5;What are corticosteroids?;Steroids are also called corticosteroids, which are anti-inflammatory medicines used to treat various conditions.
6;What are anabolic steroids, and how are they different from corticosteroids?;Anabolic steroids are often used illegally by some people to increase muscle mass. In contrast, corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory medicines used to treat various medical conditions. Anabolic steroids are not a substitute for corticosteroids and can have severe side effects like liver damage and mood swings.
7;How do steroids work?;Steroids are man-made versions of hormones that are naturally produced by the adrenal glands found above the kidneys. When taken in higher doses than what your body typically produces, steroids help reduce redness and swelling, which can be beneficial in conditions such as asthma and eczema. In addition, steroids can reduce the activity of the immune system, which is the body's natural defence against illness and infection. This can help treat autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body.
8;Can steroids be used to cure asthma completely?;Steroids cannot cure asthma completely, but they can reduce inflammation and swelling in the airways, making it easier to breathe. Steroids are commonly used to treat asthma and are usually given in the form of inhalers.
9;Can steroids be harmful if taken for a long time?;Taking steroids for a long time can lead to side effects like weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, increased risk of infections, high blood pressure, and cataracts. However, your doctor will weigh the potential risks and benefits of using steroids and may also prescribe other medications to help reduce the side effects.
10;What should you do if you experience side effects from taking steroids?;If you experience any side effects after taking steroids, you should contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor may lower your dose or recommend alternative medication. If you have difficulty breathing, swelling in your face or throat, or severe allergic reactions, seek medical attention right away.

They're different from anabolic steroids, which are often used illegally by some people to increase their muscle mass.
Types of steroids
Steroids come in many different forms.
The main types are:
tablets, syrups and liquids – such as prednisolone
inhalers – such as beclometasone and fluticasone
nasal sprays – such as beclometasone and fluticasone

1;What is HIV?;HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system, making it difficult for your body to fight everyday infections and diseases.
2;What is AIDS?;AIDS stands for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which refers to a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that occur when your immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus.
3;What are the symptoms of HIV infection?;Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after HIV infection, which lasts for a week or 2. After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years, although the virus continues to damage your immune system. This means many people with HIV do not know they're infected.
4;How is HIV transmitted?;HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person, including semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood, and breast milk. It cannot be transmitted through sweat, urine, or saliva. The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through having anal or vaginal sex without a condom, but sharing needles, syringes, or other injecting equipment can also transmit the virus.
5;How is HIV diagnosed?;The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection. Clinics may offer a finger prick blood test, which can give you a result in minutes, or home testing or home sampling kits are available to buy online or from pharmacies. If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result.
6;What is the treatment for HIV?;Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. These come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day. Without treatment, the immune system will become severely damaged, and life-threatening illnesses like cancer and severe infections can occur. However, with early diagnosis and effective treatment, most people with HIV can live a long and healthy life.
7;How can HIV be prevented?;Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV infection. There are many effective ways to prevent or reduce the risk of HIV infection, including using a condom for sex, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), treatment for HIV to reduce the viral load to undetectable, and if you use drugs, never sharing needles or other injecting equipment, including syringes, spoons, and swabs.
8;What should one do if they think they might have been exposed to HIV?;Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV. You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics, and clinics run by charities. Emergency anti-HIV medicine called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may stop you becoming infected if started within 72 hours of possible exposure to the virus – it's recommended that you start it as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours.
9;What is undetectable=untransmittable (U=U)?;For people with HIV, if you have been taking effective HIV treatment and your viral load has been undetectable for 6 months or more, it means you cannot pass the virus on through sex. This is called undetectable=untransmittable (U=U).
10;What should people with HIV do to live a healthy life?;If you're living with HIV, taking effective HIV treatment and being undetectable significantly reduces your risk of passing HIV on to others. You'll also be encouraged to take regular exercise, eat a healthy diet, stop smoking, and have yearly flu jabs to minimize the risk of getting serious illnesses. If you're planning on getting pregnant, it's important to talk to a GP. Although rare, it's possible to transmit HIV to your baby.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,1,f53cf99826,85a5e1160ada5828569a15d0d6726f666f206d22202b4719e9d12421fde4a889,"Overview
HIV and AIDS
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system and weakens your ability to fight everyday infections and disease.
AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus.
While AIDS cannot be transmitted from 1 person to another, the HIV virus can.
There's currently no cure for HIV, but there are very effective drug treatments that enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life.
With an early diagnosis and effective treatments, most people with HIV will not develop any AIDS-related illnesses and will live a near-normal lifespan.
Symptoms of HIV infection
Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after HIV infection, which lasts for a week or 2.
After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years, although the virus continues to damage your immune system.
This means many people with HIV do not know they're infected.
Anyone who thinks they could have HIV should get tested.
Some people are advised to have regular tests as they're at particularly high risk.
Read more about who's most at risk of HIV
Causes of HIV infection
HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person. This includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood and breast milk.
It's a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long.
HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat, urine or saliva.
The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through having anal or vaginal sex without a condom.
Other ways of getting HIV include:
sharing needles, syringes or other injecting equipment
transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding
The chance of getting HIV through oral sex is very low and will be dependent on many things, such as whether you receive or give oral sex and the oral hygiene of the person giving the oral sex.
Diagnosing HIV
Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV.
You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities.
Find HIV testing services near you
The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection.
It's important to be aware that:
emergency anti-HIV medicine called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may stop you becoming infected if started within 72 hours of possible exposure to the virus – it's recommended that you start it as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours
an early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the virus, reduce the risk of becoming more unwell and reduce the chance of passing the virus on to others
Both positive and negative HIV tests may need to be repeated 1 to 3 months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the window period), but you should not wait this long to seek help:
clinics may offer a finger prick blood test, which can give you a result in minutes, but it may take up to a few days to get the results of a more detailed HIV test
home testing or home sampling kits are available to buy online or from pharmacies – depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few days
If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result.
If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options.
Treatment for HIV
Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage.
These come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day.
HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV medicine very easily, but taking a combination of different medicines makes this much less likely.
Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines. It's vital these are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.
The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load. This means the level of HIV virus in your body is low enough to not be detected by a test.
Living with HIV
If you're living with HIV, taking effective HIV treatment and being undetectable significantly reduces your risk of passing HIV on to others.
You'll also be encouraged to:
take regular exercise
eat a healthy diet
stop smoking
have yearly flu jabs to minimise the risk of getting serious illnesses
Without treatment, the immune system will become severely damaged, and life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and severe infections can occur.
If you're planning on getting pregnant, it's important to talk to a GP. Although rare, it's possible to transmit HIV to your baby.
Preventing HIV
Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV infection.
There are many effective ways to prevent or reduce the risk of HIV infection, including:
using a condom for sex
post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
treatment for HIV to reduce the viral load to undetectable
if you use drugs, never sharing needles or other injecting equipment, including syringes, spoons and swabs
Speak to your local sexual health clinic or a GP for further advice about the best way to reduce your risk.
For people with HIV, if you have been taking effective HIV treatment and your viral load has been undetectable for 6 months or more, it means you cannot pass the virus on through sex.
This is called undetectable=untransmittable (U=U).

57,"Patient: Hi, I'm feeling some pressure and tightness in my chest. Could it be a heart attack?

AI-Assistant: Hello, I'm sorry to hear that. Chest pain is one symptom of a heart attack. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?

Patient: Yes, I'm also feeling lightheaded and short of breath.

AI-Assistant: Those symptoms may also be signs of a heart attack. It is important to call 999 and seek medical attention immediately if you suspect a heart attack.

Patient: I'm really scared. What should I do while waiting for the ambulance?

AI-Assistant: It is recommended to chew and swallow a tablet of aspirin (ideally 300mg) if the person having a heart attack is not allergic to aspirin. Aspirin helps to thin the blood and improve blood flow to the heart. It is also important to stay as calm as possible and avoid any physical activity.

Patient: If it is a heart attack, what can I expect in terms of treatment?

AI-Assistant: Treatment for a heart attack depends on how serious it is. In hospital, the main treatments are using medicines to dissolve blood clots or surgery to help restore blood to the heart. The recovery process aims to reduce the risk of another heart attack through a combination of lifestyle changes and medicines.

Patient: How can I prevent a heart attack from happening?

AI-Assistant: There are five main steps you can take to reduce your risk of having a heart attack: quit smoking, lose weight if you're overweight or obese, do regular exercise, eat a low-fat, high-fibre diet, and moderate your alcohol consumption. It is important to speak to your doctor about any concerns you may have and to get regular check-ups to monitor your heart health.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,1,f4df95ec69,b43e7e24b6d8d79f9368758053eaca8f4ca451e48667df9afdb7561feb213312,"Overview
Heart attack
A heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI) is a serious medical emergency in which the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked, usually by a blood clot.
A heart attack is a medical emergency. Call 999 and ask for an ambulance if you suspect a heart attack.
A lack of blood to the heart may seriously damage the heart muscle and can be life threatening.
Symptoms of a heart attack
Symptoms of a heart attack can include:
chest pain – a feeling of pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across your chest
pain in other parts of the body – it can feel as if the pain is spreading from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and tummy
feeling lightheaded or dizzy
sweating
shortness of breath
feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)
an overwhelming feeling of anxiety (similar to a panic attack)
coughing or wheezing
The chest pain is often severe, but some people may only experience minor pain, similar to indigestion.
While the most common symptom in both men and women is chest pain, women are more likely to have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, feeling or being sick and back or jaw pain.
Call 999 immediately if you think someone might be having a heart attack. The faster you act, the better their chances.
Treating heart attacks
While waiting for an ambulance, it may help to chew and then swallow a tablet of aspirin (ideally 300mg), as long as the person having a heart attack is not allergic to aspirin.
Aspirin helps to thin the blood and improves blood flow to the heart.
In hospital, treatment for a heart attack depends on how serious it is.
The 2 main treatments are:
using medicines to dissolve blood clots
surgery to help restore blood to the heart
Causes of a heart attack
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart attacks.
CHD is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart get clogged with deposits of cholesterol, known as plaques.
Before a heart attack, 1 of the plaques bursts (ruptures), causing a blood clot to develop at the site of the rupture.
The clot may block the supply of blood to the heart, triggering a heart attack.
Recovering from a heart attack
The time it takes to recover from a heart attack will depend on the amount of damage to your heart muscle.
Most people can return to work after having a heart attack. Some people are well enough to return to work after 2 weeks. Other people may take several months to recover. How quickly you can go back to work depends on your health, the state of your heart and the type of work you do.
The recovery process aims to:
reduce your risk of another heart attack through a combination of lifestyle changes (such as eating a healthy diet), and medicines (such as statins), which help to lower blood cholesterol levels
gradually restore your physical fitness so you can resume normal activities (cardiac rehabilitation)
Find out more about recovering from a heart attack
Complications of a heart attack
Complications of a heart attack can be serious and possibly life threatening.
These include:
arrhythmias – these are abnormal heartbeats. 1 type is where the heart begins beating faster and faster, then stops beating (cardiac arrest)
cardiogenic shock – where the heart's muscles are severely damaged and can no longer contract properly to supply enough blood to maintain many body functions
heart rupture – where the heart's muscles, walls or valves split apart (rupture)
These complications can happen quickly after a heart attack and are a leading cause of death.
Many people die suddenly from a complication of a heart attack before reaching hospital or within the 1st month after a heart attack.
The outlook often depends on:
age – serious complications are more likely as you get older
the severity of the heart attack – how much of the heart's muscle has been damaged during the attack
how long it took before a person received treatment – treatment for a heart attack should begin as soon as possible
Find out more about complications of a heart attack
Preventing a heart attack
There are 5 main steps you can take to reduce your risk of having a heart attack (or having another heart attack):
smokers should quit smoking
lose weight if you're overweight or obese
do regular exercise – adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week, unless advised otherwise by the doctor in charge of your care
eat a low-fat, high-fibre diet, including wholegrains and at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day
moderate your alcohol consumption

1;What is laryngitis?;Laryngitis is a condition where the voice box or vocal cords become irritated or swollen, leading to a hoarse or croaky voice, loss of voice, an irritating cough that doesn't go away, sore throat, always needing to clear your throat, and other symptoms. It is often linked to other illnesses such as colds and flu, dust and fumes allergies, acid reflux, coughing over long periods, and more.
2;How can I check if I have laryngitis?;Laryngitis usually comes on suddenly and gets worse during the first 3 days. The main symptoms are a hoarse voice, sometimes losing your voice, an irritating cough that does not go away, always needing to clear your throat, and a sore throat. Children can also have a temperature of 38C or above, be off their food or drink, or have difficulty breathing (which is rare). Often, laryngitis is linked to other illnesses such as colds and flu, so you may also have other symptoms. If you're not sure if it's laryngitis, check other sore throat symptoms.
3;How can I treat laryngitis at home?;Laryngitis usually goes away on its own within 1 to 2 weeks, and in most cases, you don't need to see a doctor. However, you can try to treat it yourself by drinking plenty of fluids, speaking as little as possible, keeping the air moist by putting out bowls of water (central heating and air conditioning make the air dry), and gargling with warm salty water (children should not try this). It's essential not to talk loudly or whisper, not smoke, not spend time in smoky or dusty places, and not drink too much caffeine or alcohol, as they cause dehydration.
4;What can a pharmacist do for laryngitis?;If you have a sore throat due to laryngitis, you can speak to a pharmacist who can give advice and suggest treatments to help alleviate your symptoms. These treatments may include paracetamol or ibuprofen, cough syrup to ease your cough and solutions to gargle or lozenges for the pain. 
5;When should I see a GP for laryngitis?;If your symptoms do not improve after two weeks, and you still have a sore throat, experience severe pain, or have difficulty in swallowing, then it is essential to see a GP. Additionally, if you continue to suffer from laryngitis or voice problems, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist.
6;What happens during a GP appointment for laryngitis?;The GP will review your symptoms and try to establish what has caused your laryngitis. They may look inside your throat using a small mirror or wipe a cotton bud around the back of your throat for testing. The GP might also arrange a blood test or refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist if you keep getting laryngitis. If your laryngitis is caused by an infection, the GP may prescribe antibiotics.
7;What should I do if I am having difficulty breathing due to laryngitis?;If you or your child are having difficulty breathing due to laryngitis, it is crucial to seek immediate medical attention. Call 999 or go to the nearest A&E department. It is equally essential to seek medical assistance if your symptoms are not improving or are getting worse despite the treatments.
8;How long does laryngitis last?;Laryngitis usually goes away by itself within 1 to 2 weeks. However, in some cases, it may last for several weeks. Treatment options like avoiding talking and gargling with warm salt water can help alleviate the symptoms and speed up the healing process.
9;What are the common causes of laryngitis?;Laryngitis is typically caused by an infection from a virus, such as cold or flu. However, several other factors can cause this condition, including allergies to things like dust and fumes, acid from your stomach coming up your throat (acid reflux), coughing over a long time, clearing your throat all the time, and more.
10;Can laryngitis be prevented?;Laryngitis caused by an infection (virus) can be prevented by getting a flu vaccination. To reduce the risk of other types of laryngitis, it helps to avoid smoking, limit your exposure to environmental irritants and pollutants, and treat allergies and acid reflux. Additionally, by practicing good hygiene, like washing your hands with soap regularly, you can help prevent the spread of viruses that can lead to laryngitis.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,1,f53cf99826,49128a937a043ab481e0d3ae77777edf045150b7298ffd5aeb7f60ba45e86305,"Laryngitis

1;What is multiple sclerosis?;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition that affects the brain and spinal cord. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including problems with vision, movement, sensation, and balance. MS is a long-term condition that can sometimes cause serious disability, although it can occasionally be mild.
2;What are the symptoms of multiple sclerosis?;The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person and can affect any part of the body. Some of the main symptoms include fatigue, difficulty walking, vision problems, bladder problems, numbness or tingling in different parts of the body, muscle stiffness and spasms, problems with balance and coordination, and problems with thinking, learning, and planning.
3;What causes multiple sclerosis?;MS is an autoimmune condition, which means something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks a healthy part of the body. In MS, the immune system attacks the protective layer around the nerves called the myelin sheath. This damages and scars the sheath, and potentially the underlying nerves, meaning that messages travelling along the nerves become slowed or disrupted. Exactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is unclear, but most experts think a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved.
4;How is multiple sclerosis diagnosed?;If you're worried you might have signs of MS, see a GP who will let you know about the specific pattern of symptoms you're experiencing. If they think you could have MS, you'll be referred to a specialist in conditions of the nervous system (a neurologist), who may suggest tests such as an MRI scan to check for features of MS. Other tests may include a lumbar puncture to check the cerebrospinal fluid or visual evoked potentials to check the speed of messages travelling along the optic nerve.
5;What are the types of multiple sclerosis?;MS starts in 1 of 2 general ways: with individual relapses or attacks, or with gradual progression. The two main types of MS are relapsing remitting MS, which is the most common type, and primary progressive MS. In relapsing remitting MS, someone will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, known as relapses, that typically last for days to weeks to months, then slowly improve. In primary progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and accumulate over several years, and there are no periods of remission.
6;What treatments exist for multiple sclerosis?;There's currently no cure for MS, but a number of treatments can help control the condition and ease symptoms. The treatment you need will depend on the specific symptoms and difficulties you have. It may include treating relapses with short courses of steroid medicine to speed up recovery, specific treatments for individual MS symptoms, or disease-modifying therapies to reduce the number of relapses. Unfortunately, there's currently no treatment that can slow the progress of primary progressive MS, or secondary progressive MS, where there are no relapses.
7;What are the disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis?;Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are treatments that aim to change the course of MS by slowing down the rate of relapses and reducing the number of new lesions that appear on MRI scans. There are several different types of DMTs available, including injectable, oral, and infusion treatments. Each type has its own side effects and risks, and the choice of which treatment to use will depend on the individual’s particular symptoms, overall health, and other factors.
8;What can someone diagnosed with MS do to improve their quality of life?;If you've been diagnosed with MS, it's important to take care of your general health. This can include exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, getting enough rest and sleep, and managing stress. There are also many other things that can help with MS symptoms, such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and counseling. Assistive devices and mobility aids can also be helpful for some people with MS.
9;What are the charities and support groups available for people with multiple sclerosis?;In the UK, there are two main charities that provide support and information for people with MS: the MS Society and the MS Trust. These organisations offer useful advice, publications, news items about ongoing research, blogs and chatrooms. They can be very useful if you, or someone you know, has just been diagnosed with MS. Additionally, there's the shift.ms website, an online community for younger people affected by MS.
10;What is the life expectancy for people with multiple sclerosis?;MS itself is rarely fatal, but complications may arise from severe MS, such as chest or bladder infections, or swallowing difficulties. The average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average, although this gap appears to be getting smaller all the time. However, it's important to remember that MS affects each individual differently, and some people can have a relatively mild course of the condition with no impact on life expectancy.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,1,f53cf99826,1278738b30df96c64d13d489dfb0406fbe2a76c96525550ebec94b13c06226c6,"Overview
Multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that can affect the brain and spinal cord, causing a wide range of potential symptoms, including problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance.
It's a lifelong condition that can sometimes cause serious disability, although it can occasionally be mild.
In many cases, it's possible to treat symptoms. Average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with MS.
It's most commonly diagnosed in people in their 20s, 30s and 40s although it can develop at any age. It's about 2 to 3 times more common in women than men.
MS is one of the most common causes of disability in younger adults.
Symptoms of multiple sclerosis
The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person and can affect any part of the body.
The main symptoms include:
fatigue
difficulty walking
vision problems, such as blurred vision
problems controlling the bladder
numbness or tingling in different parts of the body
muscle stiffness and spasms
problems with balance and co-ordination
problems with thinking, learning and planning
Depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms may come and go in phases or get steadily worse over time (progress).
Getting medical advice
See a GP if you're worried you might have signs of MS.
The symptoms often have many other causes, so they're not necessarily a sign of MS.
Let the GP know about the specific pattern of symptoms you're experiencing.
If they think you could have MS, you'll be referred to a specialist in conditions of the nervous system (a neurologist), who may suggest tests such as an MRI scan to check for features of MS.

Types of multiple sclerosis
MS starts in 1 of 2 general ways: with individual relapses (attacks or exacerbations) or with gradual progression.
Relapsing remitting MS
Between 8 and 9 of every 10 people with MS are diagnosed with the relapsing remitting type.
Someone with relapsing remitting MS will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, known as relapses.
These typically worsen over a few days, last for days to weeks to months, then slowly improve over a similar time period.
Relapses often occur without warning, but are sometimes associated with a period of illness or stress.
The symptoms of a relapse may disappear altogether, with or without treatment, although some symptoms often persist, with repeated attacks happening over several years.
Periods between attacks are known as periods of remission. These can last for years at a time.
After many years (usually decades), many, but not all, people with relapsing remitting MS go on to develop secondary progressive MS.
In this type of MS, symptoms gradually worsen over time without obvious attacks. Some people continue to have infrequent relapses during this stage.
About two-thirds of people with relapsing remitting MS will develop secondary progressive MS.
Primary progressive MS
Between 1 and 2 in every 10 people with the condition start their MS with a gradual worsening of symptoms.
In primary progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and accumulate over several years, and there are no periods of remission, though people often have periods where their condition appears to stabilise.
What causes multiple sclerosis?
MS is an autoimmune condition. This is when something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks a healthy part of the body – in this case, the brain or spinal cord of the nervous system.

The treatment you need will depend on the specific symptoms and difficulties you have.
It may include:
treating relapses with short courses of steroid medicine to speed up recovery
specific treatments for individual MS symptoms
treatment to reduce the number of relapses using medicines called disease-modifying therapies
Disease-modifying therapies may also help to slow or reduce the overall worsening of disability in people with a type of MS called relapsing remitting MS, and in some people with types called primary and secondary progressive MS, who have relapses.
Unfortunately, there's currently no treatment that can slow the progress of primary progressive MS, or secondary progressive MS, where there are no relapses.
Many therapies aiming to treat progressive MS are currently being researched.

Outlook
MS can be a challenging condition to live with, but new treatments over the past 20 years have considerably improved the quality of life of people with the condition.
MS itself is rarely fatal, but complications may arise from severe MS, such as chest or bladder infections, or swallowing difficulties.
The average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average, and this gap appears to be getting smaller all the time.

Cela signifie que le sang circule à une pression plus élevée que la normale, ce qui peut causer des dommages aux organes et augmenter le risque de maladies dangereuses telles que les maladies cardiaques, les accidents vasculaires cérébraux et l'insuffisance rénale.
2;Comment mesurer sa pression artérielle ?;La pression artérielle est mesurée avec deux nombres : la pression systolique (nombre le plus élevé) est la force à laquelle votre cœur pompe le sang dans votre corps. La pression diastolique (nombre le plus bas) est la résistance au flux sanguin dans les vaisseaux sanguins. Elles sont toutes deux mesurées en millimètres de mercure (mmHg). Le seul moyen de savoir si votre tension artérielle est élevée est de faire mesurer votre tension artérielle.
3;Pourquoi est-il important de mesurer sa pression artérielle ?;Il est important de mesurer la pression artérielle car l'hypertension artérielle est souvent asymptomatique. Si elle n'est pas traitée, elle augmente le risque de maladies cardiovasculaires graves telles que les maladies cardiaques et les accidents vasculaires cérébraux. Le dépistage précoce et le traitement de l'hypertension artérielle peuvent aider à réduire le risque de ces maladies dangereuses.
4;Quels sont les risques de l'hypertension artérielle ?;L'hypertension artérielle peut mettre une pression supplémentaire sur les vaisseaux sanguins, le cœur et d'autres organes, tels que le cerveau, les reins et les yeux. Une pression artérielle élevée persistante peut augmenter le risque de plusieurs maladies graves et potentiellement mortelles, telles que les maladies cardiaques, les accidents vasculaires cérébraux, l'insuffisance cardiaque, la maladie artérielle périphérique, les anévrismes aortiques, la maladie rénale et la démence vasculaire.
5;Comment peut-on réduire sa pression artérielle ?;Il existe des changements de style de vie qui peuvent aider à baisser la pression artérielle et à prévenir l'hypertension artérielle, notamment réduire la quantité de sel que l'on mange et avoir une alimentation équilibrée, limiter la consommation d'alcool, perdre du poids si vous êtes en surpoids, faire de l'exercice régulièrement, arrêter de fumer et réduire la consommation de caféine. Dans certains cas, une intervention médicale peut être nécessaire pour aider à réduire la pression artérielle.
6;Comment savoir si l'on a de l'hypertension artérielle ?;Le seul moyen de savoir si vous avez de l'hypertension artérielle est de faire vérifier votre pression artérielle. Tous les adultes de plus de 40 ans sont invités à faire vérifier leur pression artérielle au moins tous les 5 ans. Vous pouvez faire vérifier votre tension artérielle chez votre médecin, dans certaines pharmacies, dans le cadre de votre bilan de santé NHS ou dans certains lieux de travail.
7;Quels sont les médicaments pour l'hypertension artérielle ?;Si vous êtes diagnostiqué avec de l'hypertension artérielle, votre médecin peut recommander de prendre un ou plusieurs médicaments pour la maintenir sous contrôle. Les médicaments courants pour l'hypertension artérielle comprennent les inhibiteurs de l'enzyme de conversion, les antagonistes des récepteurs de l'angiotensine II, les bloqueurs des canaux calciques, les diurétiques, les bêta-bloquants, les alpha-bloquants et d'autres diurétiques. Le médicament recommandé pour vous dépendra de la gravité de votre hypertension artérielle, de votre âge et de votre ethnicité.
8;Comment savoir si l'on a de l'hypertension artérielle à la maison ?;La pression artérielle peut être mesurée chez soi à l'aide d'un tensiomètre. La plupart des gens ne présentent pas de symptômes d'hypertension artérielle, il est donc important de surveiller régulièrement sa pression artérielle pour détecter les changements. Si vous mesurez votre tension artérielle à la maison, il est important de suivre les instructions d'utilisation du tensiomètre et de parler à votre médecin des résultats.
9;Quand faut-il prendre des médicaments pour l'hypertension artérielle ?;Les médicaments pour l'hypertension artérielle peuvent être prescrits en fonction de la gravité de la maladie, du taux de pression systolique ou diastolique, et de l'existence d'autres problèmes de santé. Votre médecin pourra vous aider à décider si vous avez besoin de médicaments, ou si des changements de style de vie suffisent pour maintenir votre pression artérielle sous contrôle. Il est important de suivre les instructions de votre médecin et de prendre les médicaments comme prescrit.
10;Quelles sont les causes risquées de l'hypertension artérielle ?;Les causes de l'hypertension artérielle ne sont pas toujours claires, mais certains facteurs peuvent augmenter le risque, notamment le surpoids, la consommation excessive de sel et le manque de fruits et de légumes dans l'alimentation, le manque d'exercice, la consommation excessive d'alcool ou de caféine, le tabagisme, le sommeil insuffisant ou perturbé, l'âge supérieur à 65 ans, les antécédents familiaux d'hypertension artérielle, l'appartenance aux communautés noires d'Afrique ou des Caraïbes, et le fait de vivre dans un quartier défavorisé. Faire des changements de style de vie sains peut parfois aider à réduire les chances de développer une hypertension artérielle et à la maintenir sous contrôle si elle est déjà présente.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,French,1,f53cf99826,389f633b183e824369858a408aaaa1023fb2c1923b4f606f7b15cd9300a813aa,"Overview
High blood pressure (hypertension)
High blood pressure, or hypertension, rarely has noticeable symptoms. But if untreated, it increases your risk of serious problems such as heart attacks and strokes.
Around a third of adults in the UK have high blood pressure, although many will not realise it.
The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have your blood pressure checked.
What is high blood pressure?
Blood pressure is recorded with 2 numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body.
The diastolic pressure (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels.
They're both measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg).
As a general guide:
high blood pressure is considered to be from 140/90mmHg (or an average of 135/85mmHg at home) – or 150/90mmHg (or an average of 145/85mmHg at home) if you're over the age of 80
ideal blood pressure is usually considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg, while the target for over-80s is below 150/90mmHg (or 145/85mmHg at home)
Blood pressure readings between 120/80mmHg and 140/90mmHg could mean you're at risk of developing high blood pressure if you do not take steps to keep your blood pressure under control.
Everyone's blood pressure will be slightly different. What's considered low or high for you may be normal for someone else.
Risks of high blood pressure
If your blood pressure is too high, it puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes.
Persistent high blood pressure can increase your risk of a number of serious and potentially life-threatening health conditions, such as:
heart disease
heart attacks
strokes
heart failure
peripheral arterial disease
aortic aneurysms
kidney disease
vascular dementia
If you have high blood pressure, reducing it even a small amount can help lower your risk of these health conditions.
Check your blood pressure
The only way of knowing whether you have high blood pressure is to have a blood pressure test.
All adults over 40 are advised to have their blood pressure checked at least every 5 years.
Getting this done is easy and could save your life.
You can get your blood pressure tested at a number of places, including:
at your GP surgery
at some pharmacies
as part of your NHS Health Check
in some workplaces
You can also check your blood pressure yourself with a home blood pressure monitor.
Find out more about getting a blood pressure test
Things that can increase your risk of getting high blood pressure
It's not always clear what causes high blood pressure, but there are things that can increase your risk.
You might be more at risk if you:
are overweight
eat too much salt and do not eat enough fruit and vegetables
do not do enough exercise
drink too much alcohol or coffee (or other caffeine-based drinks)
smoke
do not get much sleep or have disturbed sleep
are over 65
have a relative with high blood pressure
are of black African or black Caribbean descent
live in a deprived area
Making healthy lifestyle changes can sometimes help reduce your chances of getting high blood pressure and help lower your blood pressure if it's already high.
Treatment for high blood pressure
Doctors can help you keep your blood pressure to a safe level using:
lifestyle changes
medicines
What works best is different for each person.
Talk to your doctor to help you decide about treatment.
This patient decision aid (PDF, 132kb) can also help you to understand your treatment options.
Lifestyle changes to reduce blood pressure
These lifestyle changes can help prevent and lower high blood pressure:
reduce the amount of salt you eat and have a generally healthy diet
cut back on alcohol
lose weight if you're overweight
exercise regularly
cut down on caffeine
stop smoking
Some people with high blood pressure may also need to take 1 or more medicines to stop their blood pressure getting too high.
Medicines for high blood pressure
If you're diagnosed with high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend taking 1 or more medicines to keep it under control.
These come as tablets and usually need to be taken once a day.
Common blood pressure medicines include:
ACE inhibitors – such as enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril
angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) – such as candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, valsartan and olmesartan
calcium channel blockers – such as amlodipine, felodipine and nifedipine or diltiazem and verapamil
diuretics – such as indapamide and bendroflumethiazide
beta blockers – such as atenolol and bisoprolol
alpha blockers – such as doxazosin
other diuretics – such as amiloride and spironolactone
The medicine recommended for you will depend on things like how high your blood pressure is, your age and your ethnicity."

AI-Assistant: Bonjour, comment puis-je vous aider aujourd'hui ?

Patient: Je m'inquiète pour mon bébé. Il a une toux et il semble avoir des difficultés à respirer. Je pense que c'est de la bronchiolite. Que dois-je faire ?
AI-Assistant: Il est important que vous consultiez un médecin dès que possible. Si votre bébé a des difficultés à respirer, cela peut être un symptôme de la bronchiolite avancée, qui nécessite une attention médicale immédiate. Appelez le 15 ou rendez-vous aux urgences pédiatriques. 

Patient: Quels sont les symptômes de la bronchiolite ?
AI-Assistant: Les symptômes de la bronchiolite chez les bébés et les enfants comprennent une toux, un nez qui coule ou bouché, une fièvre légère et une respiration rapide. Ils peuvent également avoir des difficultés à respirer, un sommeil perturbé et une perte d'appétit. Si vous êtes préoccupé par les symptômes de votre enfant, consultez un médecin. 

Patient: Comment peut-on traiter la bronchiolite ?
AI-Assistant: Il n'existe pas de traitement spécifique pour la bronchiolite, car il s'agit d'une infection virale qui guérit souvent d'elle-même. Cependant, vous pouvez soulager les symptômes de votre bébé en utilisant des gouttes nasales salines pour débloquer son nez et en veillant à ce qu'il soit bien hydraté en buvant des liquides. Il est important que vous suiviez les conseils de votre médecin et que vous ne donniez pas d'aspirine à votre enfant. 

Patient: Comment peut-on éviter que la bronchiolite ne se propage à d'autres personnes ?
AI-Assistant: Vous pouvez aider à prévenir la propagation de la bronchiolite en lavant fréquemment vos mains et celles de votre enfant, en nettoyant régulièrement les jouets et les surfaces et en utilisant des mouchoirs jetables. Évitez également de mettre votre bébé en contact avec des personnes atteintes de rhume ou de grippe et ne fumez pas autour de lui.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,French,1,f4df95ec69,8668e455e4f59182087c078ea3fb13875e110e98dae8711d625353e97a2c93eb,"Bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is a common chest infection that affects babies and children under 2. It's usually mild and can be treated at home, but it can be serious.
Bronchiolitis is different from bronchitis, which causes a cough with lots of mucus and can affect people of all ages.
Check if it's bronchiolitis
The early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to a cold, such as sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, a cough and a slightly high temperature of 38C.
A child with bronchiolitis may then get other symptoms, such as:
breathing more quickly
finding it difficult to feed or eat
noisy breathing (wheezing)
becoming irritable
Symptoms are usually worst between days 3 and 5, and the cough usually gets better in 3 weeks.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if:
your child is having difficulty breathing – you may notice grunting noises or their tummy sucking under their ribs
there are pauses when your child breathes
your child's skin, tongue or lips are blue
your child is floppy and will not wake up or stay awake
As a parent, you may know if your child seems seriously unwell and should trust your own judgement.
Find your nearest A&E
Urgent advice:
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if:
your child has had a cold and it's getting worse
your child is feeding or eating much less than normal
your child has had a dry nappy for 12 hours or more, or shows other signs of dehydration
your baby is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38C, or is older than 3 months and has a temperature of 39C or higher
your baby feels hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest, or feels sweaty
your child is very tired or irritable
Treatments for bronchiolitis
There's no specific treatment for bronchiolitis. It usually gets better on its own and you can look after your child at home.
But it can be serious in some children, who may need to be treated in hospital.
Do
give children's paracetamol to babies and children over 2 months old or ibuprofen to babies and children over 3 months old – but do not give aspirin to a child under 16
try using salt water (saline) drops if your child's nose is blocked
keep your child upright as much as possible when they're awake – this will help them breathe more easily
encourage your child to drink lots of fluids – try smaller feeds more often in babies, and give older children extra water or diluted fruit juice
Don’t
do not smoke around your child
do not try to lower your child's temperature by sponging them with cool water or taking off all their clothes
Preventing bronchiolitis
There are some things you can do to lower the chances of your child getting bronchiolitis or spreading the viruses that cause it, such as:
wash your hands and your child's hands often
wash or wipe down toys and clean surfaces regularly
use disposable tissues and throw them away as soon as you've used them
keep newborn babies away from anyone with a cold or the flu – especially if they're under 2 months old or were premature
It's also important not to smoke around your child. Children who breathe in cigarette smoke have a higher risk of getting bronchiolitis.
Children at risk of severe bronchiolitis
Some children may have a higher risk of getting seriously ill with bronchiolitis.
This includes children who:
were born very prematurely
have a heart or lung condition
have a weakened immune system
These children may be able to have treatment in the winter (between October and March) to stop them getting severe bronchiolitis.
Causes of bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is caused by a viral infection, usually the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
RSV is very common and spreads easily in coughs and sneezes. Almost all children have had it by the time they're 2.
In older children and adults, RSV may cause a cough or cold, but in young children it can cause bronchiolitis."

63,"ID;Question;Answer
1;Qu'est-ce que les stéroïdes?;Les stéroïdes, également appelés corticostéroïdes, sont des médicaments anti-inflammatoires utilisés pour traiter une gamme de conditions. Ils sont différents des stéroïdes anabolisants, qui sont souvent utilisés illégalement par certaines personnes pour augmenter leur masse musculaire.
2;Quels sont les types de stéroïdes?;Les stéroïdes sont disponibles sous différentes formes. Les principaux types sont les comprimés, les sirops et les liquides, tels que le prednisolone, les inhalateurs, tels que le beclométasone et le fluticasone, les sprays nasaux, tels que le beclométasone et le fluticasone, les injections, tels que le méthylprednisolone (injecté dans les articulations, les muscles ou les vaisseaux sanguins), et les crèmes, lotions et gels, tels que la crème pour la peau contenant de l'hydrocortisone.
3;Les stéroïdes peuvent-ils causer des effets secondaires?;Les stéroïdes ne causent pas généralement d'effets secondaires importants s'ils sont pris pendant une courte durée ou à faible dose. Mais parfois, ils peuvent causer des effets secondaires désagréables, tels qu'une augmentation de l'appétit, des changements d'humeur et des difficultés à dormir. Cela est le plus fréquent avec les comprimés de stéroïdes. Les effets secondaires disparaîtront généralement une fois que vous aurez terminé le traitement, mais ne cessez pas de prendre votre médicament sans en parler à votre médecin. L'arrêt d'un traitement prescrit peut provoquer d'autres effets secondaires désagréables (symptômes de sevrage).
4;Quelles sont les utilisations des stéroïdes?;Les stéroïdes peuvent être utilisés pour traiter un large éventail de maladies, notamment l'asthme, la maladie pulmonaire obstructive chronique (MPOC), la fièvre des foins, l'urticaire et l'eczéma, les douleurs articulaires ou musculaires (comme l'arthrite, le coude de tennis et l'épaule gelée), les douleurs causées par un nerf irrité ou piégé (comme la sciatique), la maladie inflammatoire de l'intestin (comme la maladie de Crohn), le lupus et la sclérose en plaques (SEP).
5;Comment fonctionnent les stéroïdes?;Les stéroïdes sont une version synthétique d'hormones normalement produites par les glandes surrénales, qui sont deux petites glandes situées au-dessus des reins. Lorsqu'ils sont pris à des doses supérieures à celle que votre corps produit normalement, les stéroïdes réduisent les rougeurs et les gonflements (inflammation). Cela peut aider à traiter des conditions inflammatoires telles que l'asthme et l'eczéma. Les stéroïdes réduisent également l'activité du système immunitaire, qui est la défense naturelle de l'organisme contre les maladies et les infections. Cela peut aider à traiter les maladies auto-immunes, telles que la polyarthrite rhumatoïde ou le lupus, qui sont causées par une attaque erronée du corps par le système immunitaire.
6;Est-ce que les stéroïdes provoquent une prise de poids?;Oui, l'utilisation de stéroïdes peut entraîner une augmentation de l'appétit, ce qui peut entraîner une prise de poids. Les stéroïdes peuvent également causer des changements d'humeur et des difficultés à dormir, ce qui peut également contribuer à un gain de poids.
7;Est-ce que les stéroïdes par inhalation ont des effets secondaires?;Les inhalateurs de stéroïdes peuvent causer des effets secondaires, mais ils sont généralement légers et temporaires. Les effets secondaires les plus courants comprennent des irritations de la gorge, une voix enrouée et une toux sèche. Dans de rares cas, les inhalateurs de stéroïdes peuvent causer une réaction allergique sévère. Si vous ressentez des effets secondaires après avoir utilisé un inhalateur de stéroïdes, parlez-en à votre médecin ou à votre pharmacien.
8;Les stéroïdes peuvent-ils être achetés sans ordonnance médicale?;La plupart des stéroïdes ne sont disponibles que sur ordonnance médicale, mais quelques-uns, tels que certaines crèmes ou sprays nasaux, peuvent être achetés en pharmacie ou en magasin. Cependant, il est toujours préférable de consulter un médecin avant de prendre tout médicament, même s'il est disponible sans ordonnance.
9;Les stéroïdes sont-ils utilisés pour traiter la douleur causée par les nerfs piégés?;Oui, les stéroïdes peuvent être utilisés pour traiter la douleur causée par un nerf irrité ou piégé, comme la sciatique. Les injections de stéroïdes peuvent aider à réduire l'inflammation autour du nerf, ce qui peut soulager la douleur.
10;Comment signaler les effets secondaires des stéroïdes?;Vous pouvez signaler tout effet secondaire suspecté au programme de cartes jaunes (Yellow Card Scheme), un système britannique de notification des effets secondaires des médicaments. Il est important de signaler les effets secondaires, car cela peut aider à améliorer la sécurité des médicaments pour tous les patients.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,French,1,f53cf99826,379ca602787973631a7a9e7bfc2329867d01917584bc417493f87bcf994da5a1,"Steroids
Steroids, also called corticosteroids, are anti-inflammatory medicines used to treat a range of conditions.
They're different from anabolic steroids, which are often used illegally by some people to increase their muscle mass.
Types of steroids
Steroids come in many different forms.
The main types are:
tablets, syrups and liquids – such as prednisolone
inhalers – such as beclometasone and fluticasone
nasal sprays – such as beclometasone and fluticasone
injections (given into joints, muscles or blood vessels) – such as methylprednisolone
creams, lotions and gels – such as hydrocortisone skin cream
Most steroids are only available on prescription, but a few (such as some creams or nasal sprays) can be bought from pharmacies and shops.
Side effects of steroids
Steroids do not tend to cause significant side effects if they're taken for a short time or at a low dose.
But sometimes they can cause unpleasant side effects, such as an increased appetite, mood changes and difficulty sleeping. This is most common with steroid tablets.
The side effects will usually pass once you finish the treatment, but do not stop taking your medicine without speaking to your doctor. Stopping a prescribed course of medicine can cause further unpleasant side effects (withdrawal symptoms).
Read more about:
side effects of steroid tablets
side effects of steroid inhalers
side effects of steroid nasal sprays
side effects of steroid injections
side effects of steroid creams
You can report any suspected side effect to the Yellow Card Scheme.
Uses for steroids
Steroids can be used to treat a wide range of conditions, including:
asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
hay fever
hives and eczema
painful joints or muscles – such as arthritis, tennis elbow and frozen shoulder
pain caused by an irritated or trapped nerve – such as sciatica
inflammatory bowel disease – such as Crohn's disease
lupus
multiple sclerosis (MS)
How steroids work
Steroids are a man-made version of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands which are 2 small glands found above the kidneys.
When taken in doses higher than the amount your body normally produces, steroids reduce redness and swelling (inflammation). This can help with inflammatory conditions such as asthma and eczema.
Steroids also reduce the activity of the immune system, which is the body's natural defence against illness and infection.
This can help treat autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body."

Atopic eczema
Atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most common form of eczema, a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, dry and cracked.
Atopic eczema is more common in children, often developing before their first birthday. But it may also develop for the first time in adults.
It's usually a long-term (chronic) condition, although it can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older.
Symptoms of atopic eczema
Atopic eczema causes the skin to become itchy, dry, cracked and sore.
Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread inflamed skin all over the body.
Inflamed skin can become red on lighter skin, and darker brown, purple or grey on darker skin. This can also be more difficult to see on darker skin.
Although atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, it most often affects the hands, insides of the elbows, backs of the knees and the face and scalp in children.
People with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups).
When to seek medical advice
See a GP if you have symptoms of atopic eczema. They'll usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions, such as:
whether the rash is itchy and where it appears
when the symptoms first began
whether it comes and goes over time
whether there's a history of atopic eczema in your family
whether you have any other conditions, such as allergies or asthma
whether something in your diet or lifestyle may be contributing to your symptoms
Typically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and 3 or more of the following:
visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin – such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional
a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above
generally dry skin in the last 12 months
a history of asthma or hay fever – children under 4 must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has 1 of these conditions
the condition started before the age of 2 (this does not apply to children under the age of 4)
Causes of atopic eczema
The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it's clear it is not down to one single thing.
Atopic eczema often occurs in people who get allergies. ""Atopic"" means sensitivity to allergens.
It can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever.
The symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather.
Sometimes food allergies can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema.
You may be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse.
Allergy tests are not usually needed, although they're sometimes helpful in identifying whether a food allergy may be triggering symptoms.
Treating atopic eczema
Treatment for atopic eczema can help to relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time.
But there's currently no cure and severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life, which may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally.
There's also an increased risk of skin infections.
Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including:
self-care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers
emollients (moisturising treatments) – used on a daily basis for dry skin
topical corticosteroids – used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups
Other types of eczema
Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin.
Other types of eczema include:
discoid eczema – a type of eczema that occurs in circular or oval patches on the skin
contact dermatitis – a type of eczema that occurs when the body comes into contact with a particular substance
varicose eczema – a type of eczema that most often affects the lower legs and is caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins
seborrhoeic eczema – a type of eczema where red, scaly patches develop on the sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears and scalp
dyshidrotic eczema (pompholyx) – a type of eczema that causes tiny blisters to erupt across the palms of the hands"

1;Qu'est-ce que le VIH?;Le VIH (virus de l'immunodéficience humaine) est un virus qui endommage les cellules de votre système immunitaire et affaiblit votre capacité à combattre les infections et les maladies courantes.
2;Comment le VIH est-il transmis?;Le VIH peut être transmis par les fluides corporels d'une personne infectée, comme le sperme, les fluides vaginaux et anaux, le sang et le lait maternel. Il ne peut pas être transmis par la sueur, l'urine ou la salive. La voie la plus courante de transmission du VIH au Royaume-Uni est par les rapports sexuels anaux ou vaginaux sans préservatif.
3;Comment est diagnostiqué le VIH?;La seule façon de savoir si vous avez le VIH est de passer un test de dépistage du VIH. Cela implique de tester un échantillon de votre sang ou de votre salive pour détecter des signes d'infection. Les services de test de dépistage du VIH sont disponibles dans les cabinets de médecins généralistes, les cliniques de santé sexuelle et les cliniques gérées par des associations caritatives.
4;Quels sont les symptômes de l'infection par le VIH?;La plupart des gens éprouvent une brève maladie semblable à la grippe 2 à 6 semaines après l'infection par le VIH, qui dure une semaine ou deux. Après la disparition de ces symptômes, le VIH peut ne pas causer de symptômes pendant de nombreuses années, bien que le virus continue de compromettre votre système immunitaire. Cela signifie que de nombreuses personnes atteintes du VIH ne savent pas qu'elles sont infectées.
5;Comment est traité le VIH?;Les médicaments antirétroviraux sont utilisés pour traiter le VIH. Ils agissent en arrêtant la réplication du virus dans le corps, permettant au système immunitaire de se réparer et en empêchant les dommages supplémentaires. La plupart des gens atteints du VIH prennent une combinaison de médicaments, qui doivent être pris tous les jours conformément aux recommandations de votre médecin. L'objectif du traitement est d'avoir une charge virale indétectable, ce qui signifie que le niveau de virus VIH dans votre corps est suffisamment bas pour ne pas être détecté par un test.
6;Peut-on prévenir le VIH?;Oui, il existe de nombreuses façons efficaces de prévenir ou de réduire le risque d'infection par le VIH, notamment utiliser un préservatif pendant les rapports sexuels, la prophylaxie post-exposition (PEP), la prophylaxie pré-exposition (PrEP) et le traitement pour réduire la charge virale à indétectable. Si vous utilisez des drogues, ne partagez jamais d'aiguilles ou d'autres équipements d'injection, y compris des seringues, des cuillères et des tampons.
7;Comment vit-on avec le VIH?;Si vous vivez avec le VIH, la prise efficace d'un traitement antirétroviral et la sensation indétectable réduit considérablement votre risque de transmettre le VIH à d'autres personnes. Vous serez également encouragé à faire de l'exercice régulièrement, à suivre un régime alimentaire sain, à arrêter de fumer et à vous faire vacciner contre la grippe chaque année pour minimiser le risque de contracter des maladies graves.
8;Le VIH est-il curable?;Il n'y a actuellement pas de cure pour le VIH, mais il existe des traitements médicamenteux très efficaces qui permettent à la plupart des personnes atteintes du virus de vivre une vie longue et saine.
9;Comment le VIH peut-il être transmis de la mère à l'enfant?;La transmission du VIH de la mère à l'enfant peut se produire pendant la grossesse, l'accouchement ou l'allaitement. Il est important pour les femmes atteintes du VIH de discuter avec un médecin des moyens de réduire le risque de transmettre le VIH à leur bébé pendant la grossesse et l'accouchement, et pour les femmes qui allaitent de passer à une alternative sûre.
10;Comment se prémunir contre le VIH lors d'une exposition possible?;Si vous pensez avoir été exposé au VIH, demandez rapidement un avis médical. Des médicaments antirétroviraux d'urgence appelés prophylaxie post-exposition (PEP) peuvent vous empêcher de contracter une infection si vous commencez à les prendre dans les 72 heures suivant une exposition possible au virus. Si votre premier test suggère que vous avez le VIH, un autre test sanguin sera nécessaire pour confirmer le résultat. Si votre test est positif, vous serez référé à une clinique spécialisée dans le VIH.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,French,1,f53cf99826,bc4dffc2c87627dec2d364d5e6e6ab66755395c4f5401e1398e331ebcddac606,"Overview
HIV and AIDS
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system and weakens your ability to fight everyday infections and disease.
AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus.
While AIDS cannot be transmitted from 1 person to another, the HIV virus can.
There's currently no cure for HIV, but there are very effective drug treatments that enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life.
With an early diagnosis and effective treatments, most people with HIV will not develop any AIDS-related illnesses and will live a near-normal lifespan.
Symptoms of HIV infection
Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after HIV infection, which lasts for a week or 2.
After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years, although the virus continues to damage your immune system.
This means many people with HIV do not know they're infected.
Anyone who thinks they could have HIV should get tested.
Some people are advised to have regular tests as they're at particularly high risk.
Read more about who's most at risk of HIV
Causes of HIV infection
HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person. This includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood and breast milk.
It's a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long.
HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat, urine or saliva.
The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through having anal or vaginal sex without a condom.
Other ways of getting HIV include:
sharing needles, syringes or other injecting equipment
transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding
The chance of getting HIV through oral sex is very low and will be dependent on many things, such as whether you receive or give oral sex and the oral hygiene of the person giving the oral sex.
Diagnosing HIV
Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV.
You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities.
Find HIV testing services near you
The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection.
It's important to be aware that:
emergency anti-HIV medicine called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may stop you becoming infected if started within 72 hours of possible exposure to the virus – it's recommended that you start it as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours
an early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the virus, reduce the risk of becoming more unwell and reduce the chance of passing the virus on to others
Both positive and negative HIV tests may need to be repeated 1 to 3 months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the window period), but you should not wait this long to seek help:
clinics may offer a finger prick blood test, which can give you a result in minutes, but it may take up to a few days to get the results of a more detailed HIV test
home testing or home sampling kits are available to buy online or from pharmacies – depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few days
If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result.
If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options.
Treatment for HIV
Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage.
These come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day.
HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV medicine very easily, but taking a combination of different medicines makes this much less likely.
Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines. It's vital these are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.
The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load. This means the level of HIV virus in your body is low enough to not be detected by a test.
Living with HIV
If you're living with HIV, taking effective HIV treatment and being undetectable significantly reduces your risk of passing HIV on to others.
You'll also be encouraged to:
take regular exercise
eat a healthy diet
stop smoking
have yearly flu jabs to minimise the risk of getting serious illnesses
Without treatment, the immune system will become severely damaged, and life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and severe infections can occur.
If you're planning on getting pregnant, it's important to talk to a GP. Although rare, it's possible to transmit HIV to your baby.
Preventing HIV
Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV infection.
There are many effective ways to prevent or reduce the risk of HIV infection, including:
using a condom for sex
post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
treatment for HIV to reduce the viral load to undetectable
if you use drugs, never sharing needles or other injecting equipment, including syringes, spoons and swabs
Speak to your local sexual health clinic or a GP for further advice about the best way to reduce your risk.
For people with HIV, if you have been taking effective HIV treatment and your viral load has been undetectable for 6 months or more, it means you cannot pass the virus on through sex.
This is called undetectable=untransmittable (U=U).

66,"Patient: Hi, j'ai une voix enrouée depuis quelques jours. Je me demande si j'ai une laryngite.

AI-Assistant: Bonjour! Je suis désolé d'entendre que vous avez des problèmes vocaux. Pourriez-vous me préciser vos symptômes?

Patient: Ma voix est très rauque et parfois je la perds complètement. J'ai aussi une toux irritante qui persiste.

AI-Assistant: Cela semble être une laryngite. Ces symptômes peuvent également être associés à d'autres maladies, telles que le rhume ou la grippe. Avez-vous d'autres symptômes?

Patient: Non, je pense que ce sont mes seuls symptômes.

AI-Assistant: OK. Pour traiter votre laryngite, vous pouvez essayer de parler le moins possible, boire beaucoup de liquides et garder l'air humide dans votre pièce.  De plus, vous pouvez également vous gargariser avec de l'eau salée tiède pour soulager votre douleur. 

Patient: Comment puis-je me gargariser correctement?

AI-Assistant: Vous pouvez dissoudre une demi-cuillère à café de sel dans un verre d'eau chaude. Gargarisez-vous avec la solution puis recrachez-la. Ne l'avalez pas. Répétez cette action plusieurs fois.  Gardez simplement à l'esprit que cela n'est pas adapté aux enfants plus jeunes.

Patient: J'ai entendu dire que certaines personnes prennent des antibiotiques pour la laryngite. Est-ce recommandé?

AI-Assistant: Si votre laryngite est causée par une infection bactérienne, votre médecin peut vous prescrire des antibiotiques. Cependant, la plupart des cas de laryngite sont causés par des virus et disparaissent d'eux-mêmes en une à deux semaines. 

Patient: Si mes symptômes ne disparaissent pas après deux semaines, dois-je consulter un médecin?

AI-Assistant: Oui. Vous devez consulter un médecin si vos symptômes ne s'améliorent pas après deux semaines ou si vous avez des difficultés à avaler ou si cela est très douloureux. Dans ce cas, votre médecin pourra vérifier si votre laryngite est causée par quelque chose de plus grave et peut vous donner des conseils supplémentaires ou vous orienter vers un spécialiste ORL.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,French,1,f4df95ec69,0b3ed53437a14a27c2adef5430acc468017a4c149127a315a6704d0fa60323a0,"Laryngitis
Laryngitis is when your voice box or vocal cords in the throat become irritated or swollen. It usually goes away by itself within 1 to 2 weeks.
Check if you have laryngitis
Laryngitis usually comes on suddenly and gets worse during the first 3 days.
The main symptoms are:
a hoarse (croaky) voice
sometimes losing your voice
an irritating cough that does not go away
always needing to clear your throat
a sore throat
Children can also:
have a temperature of 38C or above
be off their food or drink
have difficulty breathing (but this is rare)
Laryngitis is often linked to other illnesses, such as colds and flu, so you may also have other symptoms.
If you're not sure it's laryngitis, check other sore throat symptoms.
How you can treat laryngitis yourself
Laryngitis usually goes away on its own after 1 to 2 weeks and you do not need to see a GP.
Do
try to speak as little as possible
drink plenty of fluids
keep the air moist by putting out bowls of water – central heating and air conditioning make the air dry
gargle with warm salty water (children should not try this)
Don’t
do not talk loudly or whisper – both strain your voice
do not smoke
do not spend time in smoky or dusty places
do not drink too much caffeine or alcohol – they cause dehydration
How to gargle with salty water
Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water. Warm water helps salt dissolve.
Gargle with the solution then spit it out. Do not swallow it.
Repeat as often as you like.
This is not suitable for younger children.
A pharmacist can help with laryngitis
Speak to a pharmacist about your sore throat.
They can give advice and suggest treatments, including:
paracetamol or ibuprofen
cough syrup to help with your cough
solutions to gargle or lozenges for the pain
Find a pharmacy
Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
your symptoms do not improve after 2 weeks
it's very painful or it's difficult to swallow
you keep getting laryngitis or voice problems
What happens at your appointment
The GP will try to work out what has caused your laryngitis.
They may:
look inside your throat using a small mirror
wipe a cotton bud around the back of your throat for testing
arrange a blood test
refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist (if you keep getting laryngitis)
If your laryngitis is caused by an infection, the GP might prescribe antibiotics.
Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if:
you or your child are having difficulty breathing
Find your nearest A&E
What causes laryngitis
Laryngitis usually happens when you have an infection from a virus, such as cold or flu. A flu vaccination will help prevent you getting flu.
Other things that cause laryngitis include:
allergies to things like dust and fumes
acid from your stomach coming up your throat (acid reflux)
coughing over a long time
clearing your throat all the time"
67,"ID;Question;Answer
1;Qu'est-ce que la sclérose en plaques?;La sclérose en plaques (SEP) est une maladie qui peut affecter le cerveau et la moelle épinière, causant une grande variété de symptômes potentiels tels que des problèmes de vision, de mouvement des bras ou des jambes, de sensation ou d'équilibre. C'est une maladie à vie qui peut parfois causer une invalidité grave, bien qu'elle puisse parfois être légère. Dans de nombreux cas, il est possible de traiter les symptômes. L'espérance de vie moyenne est légèrement réduite pour les personnes atteintes de SEP. Elle est le plus souvent diagnostiquée chez les personnes âgées de 20, 30 et 40 ans, bien qu'elle puisse se développer à tout âge. Elle est environ 2 à 3 fois plus fréquente chez les femmes que chez les hommes.
2;Quels sont les symptômes de la sclérose en plaques?;Les symptômes de la SEP varient considérablement d'une personne à l'autre et peuvent affecter n'importe quelle partie du corps. Les principaux symptômes comprennent la fatigue, les difficultés de déplacement, les problèmes de vision, tels que la vision floue, les problèmes de contrôle de la vessie, les engourdissements ou les picotements dans différentes parties du corps, la raideur et les spasmes musculaires, les problèmes d'équilibre et de coordination, les problèmes de réflexion, d'apprentissage et de planification. En fonction du type de SEP que vous avez, vos symptômes peuvent venir et partir par phases ou s'aggraver progressivement avec le temps.
3;Comment traite-t-on la sclérose en plaques?;Il n'y a actuellement pas de traitement curatif pour la SEP. Cependant, plusieurs traitements peuvent aider à contrôler la maladie et soulager les symptômes. Le traitement dont vous avez besoin dépendra des symptômes spécifiques et des difficultés que vous rencontrez. Il peut inclure le traitement des rechutes avec de courtes cures de médicaments stéroïdes pour accélérer la guérison, des traitements spécifiques pour les symptômes individuels de la SEP et des traitements pour réduire le nombre de rechutes en utilisant des médicaments appelés traitements modificateurs de la maladie. Les thérapies modifiantes de la maladie peuvent également aider à ralentir ou à réduire la détérioration globale de l'invalidité chez les personnes atteintes de la forme récurrente-rémittente de la SEP et chez certaines personnes atteintes des formes appelées primaire et secondaire progressive de la SEP qui ont des rechutes.
4;Comment vit-on avec la sclérose en plaques?;Si vous avez été diagnostiqué avec la SEP, il est important de prendre soin de votre santé en général. Des conseils pour mieux vivre avec la SEP peuvent être trouvés auprès des associations telles que MS Society, MS Trust et shift.ms, une communauté en ligne pour les jeunes adultes touchés par la SEP. Les associations offrent des conseils utiles, des publications, des actualités sur les recherches en cours, des blogs et des salles de discussion. Il est également conseillé de consulter régulièrement un professionnel de la santé, de mener une vie saine avec une alimentation équilibrée et de l'exercice régulier.
5;Qui peut diagnostiquer la sclérose en plaques?;Si vous êtes inquiet d'avoir des signes de SEP, il est recommandé de consulter un médecin généraliste en premier. Les symptômes ont souvent de nombreuses autres causes, donc ils ne sont pas nécessairement un signe de SEP. Informez bien votre médecin généraliste sur les symptômes spécifiques que vous ressentez. S'ils pensent que vous pourriez avoir la SEP, vous serez alors référé à un spécialiste des maladies du système nerveux (un neurologue), qui pourra suggérer des examens tels qu'une IRM pour détecter les caractéristiques de la SEP.
6;Y a-t-il des remèdes pour la sclérose en plaques?;Il n'existe actuellement aucun remède curatif pour la SEP, mais plusieurs traitements peuvent aider à contrôler la maladie et soulager les symptômes, notamment le traitement des rechutes avec de courtes cures de médicaments stéroïdes, les traitements spécifiques pour les symptômes individuels de la SEP et les traitements pour réduire le nombre de rechutes en utilisant des médicaments appelés traitements modificateurs de la maladie. Cependant, il n'y a actuellement aucun traitement qui peut ralentir la progression de la SEP progressive primaire ou de la SEP progressive secondaire, où il n'y a pas de rechutes. De nombreuses thérapies visant à traiter la SEP progressive sont actuellement en cours de recherche.
7;La sclérose en plaques est-elle mortelle?;La SEP elle-même est rarement fatale, mais des complications peuvent survenir en raison d'une SEP grave, telles que des infections pulmonaires ou de la vessie ou des difficultés à avaler. L'espérance de vie moyenne pour les personnes atteintes de SEP est d'environ 5 à 10 ans de moins que la moyenne. Il convient de noter que cet écart semble être en train de se réduire.
8;Quelle est la cause de la sclérose en plaques?;La SEP est une maladie auto-immune. Cela se produit lorsqu'il y a un dysfonctionnement du système immunitaire, qui attaque à tort une partie saine du corps - dans ce cas, le cerveau ou la moelle épinière du système nerveux. Dans la SEP, le système immunitaire attaque la couche qui entoure et protège les nerfs appelée la gaine de myéline. Cela endommage et cicatrise la gaine, et potentiellement les nerfs sous-jacents, ce qui signifie que les messages circulant le long des nerfs deviennent ralentis ou perturbés. On ignore exactement pourquoi le système immunitaire agit de cette manière, mais la plupart des experts estiment qu'une combinaison de facteurs génétiques et environnementaux est impliquée.
9;Quel est le type le plus courant de sclérose en plaques?;Le type le plus courant de SEP est la forme récurrente-rémittente. Entre 8 et 9 personnes sur 10 atteintes de SEP sont diagnostiquées avec ce type. Une personne atteinte de SEP récurrente-rémittente aura des épisodes de nouveaux ou d'aggravation de symptômes, appelés rechutes. Ces dernières s'aggravent typiquement sur quelques jours, durent de quelques jours à quelques semaines à plusieurs mois, puis s'améliorent lentement sur une période similaire. Les rechutes surviennent souvent sans avertissement, mais sont parfois associées à une période de maladie ou de stress. Les symptômes d'une rechute peuvent disparaître complètement, avec ou sans traitement, bien que certains symptômes persistent souvent, avec des attaques répétées se produisant sur plusieurs années. Les périodes entre les attaques sont connues sous le nom de périodes de rémission. Celles-ci peuvent durer plusieurs années. Après de nombreuses années (généralement des décennies), de nombreuses personnes atteintes de SEP récurrente-rémittente développent une forme progressive secondaire de la SEP. Dans ce type de SEP, les symptômes empirent progressivement au fil du temps sans attaques évidentes. Certaines personnes continuent à avoir des rechutes peu fréquentes pendant cette période. Environ les deux tiers des personnes atteintes de SEP récurrente-rémittente développeront une forme progressive secondaire de la SEP.
10;Quel est le pourcentage de personnes atteintes de sclérose en plaques qui commencent avec une aggravation progressive des symptômes?;Entre 1 et 2 personnes sur 10 atteintes de la maladie commencent leur SEP avec une aggravation progressive des symptômes. Dans la SEP progressive primaire, les symptômes s'aggravent progressivement et s'accumulent sur plusieurs années, sans période de rémission, bien que les patients connaissent souvent des périodes où leur état semble se stabiliser.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,French,1,f53cf99826,9684f5204e042e6fd0e2fa7bd0543e5f55daec1d6e8c4441b07f49c4bc9f940f,"Overview
Multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that can affect the brain and spinal cord, causing a wide range of potential symptoms, including problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance.
It's a lifelong condition that can sometimes cause serious disability, although it can occasionally be mild.
In many cases, it's possible to treat symptoms. Average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with MS.
It's most commonly diagnosed in people in their 20s, 30s and 40s although it can develop at any age. It's about 2 to 3 times more common in women than men.
MS is one of the most common causes of disability in younger adults.
Symptoms of multiple sclerosis
The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person and can affect any part of the body.
The main symptoms include:
fatigue
difficulty walking
vision problems, such as blurred vision
problems controlling the bladder
numbness or tingling in different parts of the body
muscle stiffness and spasms
problems with balance and co-ordination
problems with thinking, learning and planning
Depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms may come and go in phases or get steadily worse over time (progress).
Getting medical advice
See a GP if you're worried you might have signs of MS.
The symptoms often have many other causes, so they're not necessarily a sign of MS.
Let the GP know about the specific pattern of symptoms you're experiencing.
If they think you could have MS, you'll be referred to a specialist in conditions of the nervous system (a neurologist), who may suggest tests such as an MRI scan to check for features of MS.
Find out more about diagnosing MS
Types of multiple sclerosis
MS starts in 1 of 2 general ways: with individual relapses (attacks or exacerbations) or with gradual progression.
Relapsing remitting MS
Between 8 and 9 of every 10 people with MS are diagnosed with the relapsing remitting type.
Someone with relapsing remitting MS will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, known as relapses.
These typically worsen over a few days, last for days to weeks to months, then slowly improve over a similar time period.
Relapses often occur without warning, but are sometimes associated with a period of illness or stress.
The symptoms of a relapse may disappear altogether, with or without treatment, although some symptoms often persist, with repeated attacks happening over several years.
Periods between attacks are known as periods of remission. These can last for years at a time.
After many years (usually decades), many, but not all, people with relapsing remitting MS go on to develop secondary progressive MS.
In this type of MS, symptoms gradually worsen over time without obvious attacks. Some people continue to have infrequent relapses during this stage.
About two-thirds of people with relapsing remitting MS will develop secondary progressive MS.
Primary progressive MS
Between 1 and 2 in every 10 people with the condition start their MS with a gradual worsening of symptoms.
In primary progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and accumulate over several years, and there are no periods of remission, though people often have periods where their condition appears to stabilise.
What causes multiple sclerosis?
MS is an autoimmune condition. This is when something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks a healthy part of the body – in this case, the brain or spinal cord of the nervous system.
In MS, the immune system attacks the layer that surrounds and protects the nerves called the myelin sheath.
This damages and scars the sheath, and potentially the underlying nerves, meaning that messages travelling along the nerves become slowed or disrupted.
Exactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is unclear, but most experts think a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved.
Treatments for multiple sclerosis
There's currently no cure for MS, but a number of treatments can help control the condition and ease symptoms.
The treatment you need will depend on the specific symptoms and difficulties you have.
It may include:
treating relapses with short courses of steroid medicine to speed up recovery
specific treatments for individual MS symptoms
treatment to reduce the number of relapses using medicines called disease-modifying therapies
Disease-modifying therapies may also help to slow or reduce the overall worsening of disability in people with a type of MS called relapsing remitting MS, and in some people with types called primary and secondary progressive MS, who have relapses.
Unfortunately, there's currently no treatment that can slow the progress of primary progressive MS, or secondary progressive MS, where there are no relapses.
Many therapies aiming to treat progressive MS are currently being researched.
Living with multiple sclerosis
If you have been diagnosed with MS, it's important to take care of your general health.
Read more advice about living with MS
Outlook
MS can be a challenging condition to live with, but new treatments over the past 20 years have considerably improved the quality of life of people with the condition.
MS itself is rarely fatal, but complications may arise from severe MS, such as chest or bladder infections, or swallowing difficulties.
The average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average, and this gap appears to be getting smaller all the time.
Charities and support groups for multiple sclerosis
There are 2 main MS charities in the UK:
MS Society
MS Trust
These organisations offer useful advice, publications, news items about ongoing research, blogs and chatrooms.
They can be very useful if you, or someone you know, has just been diagnosed with MS.
There's also the shift.ms website, an online community for younger people affected by MS.

68,"Patient: Hi, I am a bit concerned about my blood pressure. What is high blood pressure exactly?

AI-Assistant: Hello! High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is when the force of blood against your artery walls is too high. If left untreated, it can lead to serious health problems like heart attacks and strokes.

Patient: How would I know if I have high blood pressure?

AI-Assistant: High blood pressure typically has no obvious symptoms, so the only way to know for sure is to get your blood pressure checked by a healthcare professional. Generally, adults over 40 years of age should have their blood pressure checked at least every 5 years.

Patient: What is considered high blood pressure?

AI-Assistant: Blood pressure is recorded with two numbers: the systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body, and the diastolic pressure (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels. As a general guide, high blood pressure is considered to be above 140/90 mmHg, although this can vary based on age and other factors.

Patient: Can high blood pressure be dangerous?

AI-Assistant: Yes, high blood pressure can be very dangerous if left unchecked. It can increase your risk of serious and potentially life-threatening health conditions, such as heart disease, strokes, and kidney disease.

Patient: What causes high blood pressure?

AI-Assistant: It's not always clear what causes high blood pressure, but there are several factors that can increase your risk, including being overweight, not getting enough exercise, eating too much salt, and drinking too much alcohol. There may also be a genetic component, as having a family history of high blood pressure can increase your risk.

Patient: How can I prevent or treat high blood pressure?

AI-Assistant: Making healthy lifestyle changes can help prevent high blood pressure and lower it if it's already high. This includes things like reducing the amount of salt you eat, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight. In some cases, medication may also be needed to manage high blood pressure. It's important to talk to your doctor to determine the best course of action for you.",nhs_conditions_small_sample,English,0,f4df95ec69,b907231bfa6b1a0293a2ee7a6361157ec5437e4aa47d49723edbe2e4558c86df,"Overview
High blood pressure (hypertension)
High blood pressure, or hypertension, rarely has noticeable symptoms. But if untreated, it increases your risk of serious problems such as heart attacks and strokes.
Around a third of adults in the UK have high blood pressure, although many will not realise it.
The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have your blood pressure checked.
What is high blood pressure?
Blood pressure is recorded with 2 numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body.
The diastolic pressure (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels.
They're both measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg).
As a general guide:
high blood pressure is considered to be from 140/90mmHg (or an average of 135/85mmHg at home) – or 150/90mmHg (or an average of 145/85mmHg at home) if you're over the age of 80
ideal blood pressure is usually considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg, while the target for over-80s is below 150/90mmHg (or 145/85mmHg at home)
Blood pressure readings between 120/80mmHg and 140/90mmHg could mean you're at risk of developing high blood pressure if you do not take steps to keep your blood pressure under control.
Everyone's blood pressure will be slightly different. What's considered low or high for you may be normal for someone else.
Risks of high blood pressure
If your blood pressure is too high, it puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes.
Persistent high blood pressure can increase your risk of a number of serious and potentially life-threatening health conditions, such as:
heart disease
heart attacks
strokes
heart failure
peripheral arterial disease
aortic aneurysms
kidney disease
vascular dementia
If you have high blood pressure, reducing it even a small amount can help lower your risk of these health conditions.
Check your blood pressure
The only way of knowing whether you have high blood pressure is to have a blood pressure test.
All adults over 40 are advised to have their blood pressure checked at least every 5 years.
Getting this done is easy and could save your life.
You can get your blood pressure tested at a number of places, including:
at your GP surgery
at some pharmacies
as part of your NHS Health Check
in some workplaces
You can also check your blood pressure yourself with a home blood pressure monitor.

Things that can increase your risk of getting high blood pressure
It's not always clear what causes high blood pressure, but there are things that can increase your risk.
You might be more at risk if you:
are overweight
eat too much salt and do not eat enough fruit and vegetables
do not do enough exercise
drink too much alcohol or coffee (or other caffeine-based drinks)
smoke
do not get much sleep or have disturbed sleep
are over 65
have a relative with high blood pressure
are of black African or black Caribbean descent
live in a deprived area
Making healthy lifestyle changes can sometimes help reduce your chances of getting high blood pressure and help lower your blood pressure if it's already high.

Medicines for high blood pressure
If you're diagnosed with high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend taking 1 or more medicines to keep it under control.
These come as tablets and usually need to be taken once a day.
Common blood pressure medicines include:
ACE inhibitors – such as enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril
angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) – such as candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, valsartan and olmesartan
calcium channel blockers – such as amlodipine, felodipine and nifedipine or diltiazem and verapamil
diuretics – such as indapamide and bendroflumethiazide
beta blockers – such as atenolol and bisoprolol
alpha blockers – such as doxazosin
other diuretics – such as amiloride and spironolactone
The medicine recommended for you will depend on things like how high your blood pressure is, your age and your ethnicity."
